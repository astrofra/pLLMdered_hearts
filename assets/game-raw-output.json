Rodney -- help my daughter. I'll\ntake Nick.\"\n   Cookie leans over you. \"We must get back to the ship, Miss. Dragoons\nsurround the house.\" Nicholas, injured but still arguing, is already on the\nveranda, half-forced, half-supported by your father, shadowed by Lucy.\nCookie helps you to your feet and rushes after them, expecting you to\nfollow. Lafond lies nearby, apparently unconscious.\n\nBallroom\n   Lafond, his wig awry, sprawls across the parquet floor.\n   You can see breeches, a shirt, a flower, a large key, a powder horn and\na bit of mirror here.\n\n>\nYour next move will be : TAKE HORN", "a3bc9fadc061659bcb79377aeef978206d0701f7ff2483499b2dff1ebf836147": "Taken.\n\n>\nYour next move will be : SOUTH", "6b1fa3c55a1a9edf35a3f3e58676ffbb07972169380438d8ecd62bfde9a59849": "Veranda\n\n>\nYour next move will be : SOUTH", "3fcfdbc11da20609cb20556651d97e157743f69e1b374f00238f8268028c7917": "Lawn\n\n>\nYour next move will be : SOUTH", "113bb8c4963fd796f18f0259705c2b0af96f14e7617ed2a30a6ad9b8e4e01a2f": "Beach\n   Cookie, Lucy and your father are moving towards the skiff.\n   Nicholas stands alone at one edge of the beach. He has a rapier.\n   You splash into the rising surf and pain needles up your leg. Blood\nswirls out from your shoe in the shallow water, flowing over a small\npointed stone.\n\n>\nYour next move will be : LOOK AT NICHOLAS", "372779e0304fca67d08af76a7ea78ddae06e269f8bea78a0930a04a1ea9336c9": "Jamison carries an aura of power unusual in men so slim and tall, the\nstrength of a willow in his hard seaworn body, straight shouldered and\nresilient. Chestnut hair, tousled by the wind, frames the tanned oval of\nhis face. A jagged scar etches one cheek, harsh against the warmth of his\nlimpid blue eyes.\n   A shot rings out over the roar of the surf. Turning, you see that Lafond\nstands at the top of the cliff, a pistol in each hand. \"Trying to sneak out\nthe back, cowards? You will die like your brother, Falcon. Snivelling for\nmercy.\" He hands one gun to Crulley, standing nearby, and levels the other\nat Jamison.\n\n>\nYour next move will be : PUSH NICHOLAS", "f088dc53d7810394b39ec1d4ddb30d73fbbccca845840904d1eb15c81dcb3e6a": "Pushing Captain Jamison has no desirable effect.\n   As the gun fires, Cookie throws himself before his captain. He cries\nout, blood blossoming on his shoulder, and falls face first into the sand.\nLucy runs to him.\n   Jamison yells up the cliff, brandishing his sword. \"Fight like a man,\nLafond. You have drawn my blood once tonight -- let me draw yours.\"\n   Lafond sneers. \"On one condition. If I win, your lady comes to me. You\nwill have no need of her when you are dead.\"\n   Nicholas stiffens, glances at the dragoons on the cliff above, and turns\nslowly to you. He says nothing, his face hard, but his eyes tell you what\nyou want to know. \"Answer, my darling. Yes or no?\"\n\n>\nYour next move will be : NICHOLAS, YES", "b868ab9368633d7b95649da174c79ab3486c39c4229beb89618dd93bb415423a": "He fails to notice you've spoken.\n   Nicholas looks determined. \"I accept. So long as my people go free if I\nwin. Order your dragoons to obey us, then.\" In answer, Lafond jumps off the\ncliff like a huge brocaded bat to land in front of Captain Jamison. \"Die\nthen, fool!\"\n   The pistol, spinning from Lafond's grip, drops to the sand nearby.\n\n>\nYour next move will be : TAKE PISTOL", "88e8d90955b8f69986e28ff9dcb9f81496fbcabbb9e8e15c3b1f36969ae083cf": "Taken.\n   Lafond immediately takes the advantage, forcing Nicholas in a retreat\ntowards the foaming surf. But Nicholas fights hard, jaw set, ignoring his\nwounds. Lafond finally loses his smile.\n   Behind the duellists, far away atop the cliff, you notice Crulley madly\nreloading the pistol.\n\n>\nYour next move will be : LOAD PISTOL", "6109f8fc24ecd066a72f846240a577ff8850a2cced840e9567ef2a791c6e0e83": "You pour a lumpy stream of gunpowder mixture into the barrel of the pistol\ntamping it as best you can.\n   Suddenly the force of the duel turns, Nicholas advancing against\nLafond's retreat. Their blades silently flash in the moonlight. Lafond is\npressed back into the shadow of the cliff, sweat beading on his forehead.\nAbruptly, Jamison leaps forward, metal scrapes, and his rapier licks neatly\ninto Lafond's ribs, like a snake slipping into its burrow. The body of the\ngovernor of St. Sinistra convulses, as in amazement, then sags dead on the\nsword.\n   Nicholas removes a gold ring from the dead man's finger, throwing his\nown cheap copy into the surf.\n   Far above him, Crulley moves down the stairs.\n\n>\nYour next move will be : FIRE PISTOL AT CRULLEY"}
