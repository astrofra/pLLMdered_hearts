Amy Briggs recounts her experience at Infocom as a mixture of chance, creative intensity, and gradual disillusionment. She entered the company almost accidentally in the early 1980s, after breaking up with a boyfriend and impulsively deciding to move to Massachusetts. Discovering a job ad for game testers at Infocom, she applied, was quickly hired, and found herself inside a company that felt unlike any workplace she had known. At the time, she had little sense of how unusual Infocom was, as it was her first job out of college.
Briggs began as a tester, part of a group closely connected to the implementers (“Imps”), the writers-programmers responsible for Infocom’s games. Testing was not merely about finding crashes or bugs, but about identifying where a fictional world broke down—where player expectations exceeded what the game could reasonably implement. This role gave her an unusually deep understanding of how text adventures were built, from early, broken alpha versions to finished works. That proximity made the transition from tester to implementer feel natural rather than aspirational.
Her move into game creation came at a precarious moment in Infocom’s history. The company was expanding, relocating to a sleek new office, and betting heavily on Cornerstone, a business software product meant to transform Infocom into a more “serious” company. Briggs recalls being swept up in the excitement of this shift, even though it ultimately proved disastrous. As Cornerstone failed and Infocom was acquired by Activision, layoffs followed and the internal atmosphere changed. The free, lightly managed creative culture that had allowed the games group to flourish began to erode under pressure and fear.
Encouraged by Steve Meretzky, Briggs decided to apply for an implementer position. She was told bluntly that opportunities were rare and that if she wanted the job, she had to act immediately. Her test game was deliberately strange and abstract, avoiding realistic settings that might expose weaknesses in her implementation skills. She was hired, becoming one of the few women to design an Infocom game. Her first project was Plundered Hearts, a romantic, swashbuckling adventure written from a female perspective.
Briggs emphasizes that Plundered Hearts was not imposed on her by management. Writing romance aligned with her own interests and her long-standing desire to explore that genre. At the time, “games for girls” were often condescending or trivial, and she saw romance as a legitimate narrative form rather than a marketing gimmick. Still, the game’s positioning as “a woman writing for women” became central to its reception, sometimes in ways she found frustrating. Some critics accused the game of being anti-feminist because it constrained the protagonist’s actions, while others dismissed it for not conforming to expectations of empowerment.
From a technical perspective, Plundered Hearts was ambitious and difficult. Briggs completed it early, then spent months cutting content to fit the memory constraints of platforms like the Commodore 64. Space limitations shaped design decisions, including frequent player deaths, which served as a crude but effective way to simplify puzzle design. She also recalls lingering embarrassment over bugs that slipped into the final release, highlighting how even experienced testing could miss obvious player actions.
Commercially, the game underperformed by Infocom’s standards, selling roughly half of what an average title sold at the time. Internally, this was treated as a disappointment, though Briggs stresses that nearly every game not matching Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy was judged similarly. Years later, however, she was surprised and moved to discover that Plundered Hearts had left a lasting impression on players, particularly those who encountered it indirectly through siblings. What she had experienced as a failed experiment was remembered by others as meaningful and formative.
After Plundered Hearts, Briggs struggled to find alignment with management about future projects. She proposed ideas ranging from vampire fiction inspired by Anne Rice to Doctor Who, but none gained traction. Increasingly, Infocom’s leadership demanded guaranteed commercial success without offering clear creative direction. This contradiction, combined with the broader panic following Cornerstone’s collapse, made continued work untenable. She ultimately left Infocom, convinced that what had made the company great—creative neglect and trust—had been replaced by micromanagement and fear.
Looking back, Briggs describes Infocom as a brief “Camelot”: a rare moment when individual vision, technical constraint, and collaborative support aligned. She remains skeptical that such conditions can easily be recreated, particularly in an industry now dominated by large teams, heavy budgets, and cinematic expectations. For her, text adventures were closer to books than films, and Infocom’s legacy lies in that unique blend of literature and play.
