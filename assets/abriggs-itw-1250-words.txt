This document summarizes an extended interview with Amy Briggs, focusing on her time at Infocom in the 1980s and the creation of the interactive fiction game *Plundered Hearts*. The interview offers a rare first‑person account of Infocom’s internal culture, creative processes, gender dynamics, and the broader factors that contributed to both the company’s creative peak and its eventual decline.
Amy Briggs describes her entry into Infocom as largely accidental and driven by circumstance rather than a planned career path. Fresh out of college in the early 1980s, she had been exposed to early text adventures through a technically inclined boyfriend and had already played some Infocom titles before ever considering working there. After a breakup, she moved to Massachusetts almost on a whim, motivated partly by personal upheaval and partly by curiosity. Upon arrival, she discovered job listings for testers at Infocom, applied, and was hired with remarkable ease. This sense of serendipity, which she characterizes as “kismet,” sets the tone for much of her narrative.
Briggs initially joined Infocom as a game tester, a role that placed her close to the creative heart of the company. She experienced the transition from Infocom’s older Wheeler Street offices to the more corporate Cambridge Park location, witnessing firsthand the shift from a scrappy, artisan‑like environment to a polished, glass‑and‑atrium corporate space. At the time, Infocom was heavily invested in Cornerstone, a business database product, and there was strong internal belief that games were merely a temporary means to fund more “serious” business software. Briggs admits she was initially swept up in the excitement surrounding Cornerstone and the promise of becoming a “real” business, only later recognizing how damaging this strategic miscalculation was for the company.
The tester role at Infocom went far beyond conventional quality assurance. Briggs emphasizes that testers were deeply involved in evaluating not only technical bugs but also narrative coherence, parser expectations, and the internal logic of the fictional worlds. Testing meant asking whether a world “made sense” to a player, not just whether it crashed. This close relationship between testers and implementers (Infocom’s term for game authors) made testing an ideal apprenticeship for becoming an implementer.
After layoffs, the Cornerstone failure, and Infocom’s acquisition by Activision, opportunities to become an implementer became rare. Briggs recounts a pivotal conversation with Steve Meretzky, who warned her that if she wanted to move up, she had to do it immediately. Following his advice, she wrote a demonstration game to prove her ability. Drawing on her background in testing and some prior programming experience, she learned to work with ZIL, Infocom’s programming language. Although she received guidance, she emphasizes that she was not “hand‑held”; the expectation was self‑sufficiency within a supportive peer culture.
Infocom at this time was a strikingly young company. Most employees were in their early twenties, largely single, and treated the workplace as both home and social center. Briggs describes extraordinarily long working hours that felt voluntary rather than imposed: full days testing, followed by evenings and weekends writing her own game. This was not exceptional behavior but part of the broader culture. People stayed late to work, play games, or simply socialize. The company was always open, reinforcing the sense that Infocom was not just a job but a lived environment.
Briggs’s first full game, *Plundered Hearts*, was an unconventional choice. It was a romance‑driven interactive fiction game written by a woman and centered on a female protagonist, set against a swashbuckling pirate backdrop. While she acknowledges some internal skepticism—Meretzky advised that it was an overly ambitious first project—she chose to proceed anyway. The decision to write a romance came from her own interests rather than a direct mandate from management, although marketing later emphasized the “women writing for women” angle.
She situates *Plundered Hearts* within the broader context of 1980s attempts to create “games for girls,” many of which she criticizes as patronizing and creatively bankrupt. Unlike cooking or sewing games, *Plundered Hearts* attempted to engage female players through narrative, emotion, and character rather than stereotypical activities. However, Briggs is careful not to claim the game as a definitive feminist intervention. She doubts that the solitary, parser‑based mode of play was inherently appealing to teenage girls and acknowledges that later designers, such as Brenda Laurel, found more effective approaches.
Critical reception to *Plundered Hearts* was mixed. Some reviewers dismissed it as overly feminist, while others criticized its constraints on player behavior, such as not allowing the protagonist to engage in traditionally “tough” actions like karate chopping enemies. Briggs reflects thoughtfully on these critiques, framing them as part of a deeper philosophical tension in interactive fiction: how much freedom a player should have versus how strongly a character should be authored.
From a technical perspective, *Plundered Hearts* was constrained by hardware limitations. It was one of the last Infocom games to fit on platforms like the Commodore 64, forcing Briggs to spend months cutting content after finishing the initial version early. She candidly admits lingering embarrassment over certain bugs and parser limitations that slipped through testing, illustrating how difficult it was to balance realism, player expectations, and memory constraints.
Commercially, *Plundered Hearts* sold poorly by Infocom standards, moving roughly 30,000 copies at a time when expectations were closer to 150,000. Briggs recalls internal disappointment, though she emphasizes that nearly every game that failed to match *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy* was treated as a failure. Years later, however, she experienced a reevaluation of the game’s legacy when former players sought her out to express how meaningful it had been to them. This delayed recognition reframed the game in her mind from a failed experiment to a work with lasting personal impact.
After *Plundered Hearts*, Briggs struggled to find a follow‑up project that aligned with both her interests and Infocom’s increasingly desperate marketing demands. She proposed ideas ranging from a vampire game inspired by Anne Rice to a *Doctor Who* adaptation, but none gained traction. She describes this period as one of fear and panic within the company, where management demanded hits without offering clear creative direction.
Her breaking point came when she was assigned to work on a sequel to *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy* under conditions that stripped her of creative authorship. Faced with the prospect of merely implementing someone else’s vision, she chose to quit both the project and, soon after, Infocom itself.
Reflecting on Infocom’s rise and fall, Briggs offers a powerful diagnosis. The company thrived when games were “pleasantly neglected,” allowing creative autonomy to flourish. Its decline began when management attempted to micromanage creativity in response to financial pressure. What had once been an environment of trust and individual vision became one of fear and control, undermining the very conditions that had made Infocom exceptional.
Briggs left the games industry entirely at age 26, intending to write fiction. Although she never completed the novel she imagined, she does not express regret so much as a sense of life unfolding unpredictably. She remembers Infocom as a kind of Camelot: a brief, extraordinary moment of creative intensity unlikely to be replicated under modern commercial conditions.
In closing, Briggs reflects on the nature of interactive fiction itself. She views Infocom games as closer to books than to modern, cinematic video games, emphasizing individual vision over spectacle. While she expresses skepticism about committing to long modern games, she acknowledges the vitality of amateur and independent interactive fiction communities. Her account ultimately stands as both a personal memoir and a critical reflection on creativity, gender, and institutional failure in early game history.
