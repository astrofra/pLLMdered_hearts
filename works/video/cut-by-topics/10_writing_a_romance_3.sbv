Boy, I used a parser that was already done 
and I had to strip it way down. I don't know

0:00:07.520,0:00:12.080
if if nobody has told you my story, which was 
they they gave me cuz it was my first game,

0:00:12.080,0:00:17.600
they gave me nine months to write it and I 
finished it in six. Um, and then spent the

0:00:17.600,0:00:23.040
next three just cutting stuff out. It was way 
way too big to fit because I was the last game

0:00:23.040,0:00:29.280
to fit on I think it was a Commodore 64. So, um, 
it was all that great stuff that had to be cut.

0:00:29.280,0:00:36.640
And so I did a lot of cutting, but I started 
with a blackbox um parser. And I don't think

0:00:36.640,0:00:42.800
I started with any other game. I mean, I could 
be because it was it was a different it it was

0:00:42.800,0:00:46.880
just coming at things differently. If I did, it 
would have been prism because it was in my mind

0:00:46.880,0:00:51.760
it was the most like a mind forever voyaging. 
Sorry, which we called prism in development.

0:00:51.760,0:00:55.440
Um, but I'm pretty sure I didn't because 
that was so huge that I would I would have

0:00:55.440,0:00:58.480
spent my first six months just cutting stuff 
out of that to make it small enough to build
