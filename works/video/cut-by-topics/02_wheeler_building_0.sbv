I started at Wheeler and they moved in my first 
month or two. Okay. So, so I got to see both

0:00:05.680,0:00:11.520
sort of the end of the old and the beginning 
of the new and I was new enough and arrived at

0:00:11.520,0:00:16.480
a time when everything was expanding and the 
excitement was all about cornerstone and how

0:00:16.480,0:00:20.080
we're going to be business. We're going to be 
button down. We're going to be real. None of

0:00:20.080,0:00:25.760
these game things. And I I got caught up in that 
even though I was hired on the game side. Um,

0:00:25.760,0:00:32.000
and so I was all for the move and the cool new 
building with the glass and the atriums and and

0:00:32.000,0:00:41.520
um it was um I suppose it was an interesting 
um not a loss of innocence so much but to see

0:00:41.520,0:00:46.720
if I look back at myself of learning what 
the mistakes were being made um even as

0:00:46.720,0:00:51.520
that happened I was able to sort of experience 
them myself with with getting caught up in the

0:00:51.520,0:00:56.880
excitement of of the new idea and then seeing how 
that was really a bad idea for Infocom. And then

0:00:56.880,0:01:01.680
of course I ended up as an imp. So I I moved 
much further into the other side of things.
