0:00:01.680,0:00:07.840
oh yeah i mean that's that's easy that's an easy 
question i um was in college i had a boyfriend

0:00:07.840,0:00:13.440
who was ahead of the game and he actually sold 
computers it's in the early 80s so he was ahead

0:00:14.560,0:00:20.000
i had he was a geek like most of the people i 
like and um he introduced me we would stay up

0:00:20.000,0:00:25.040
late playing tax adventure games so the first 
one i played actually was a scott adams game

0:00:25.040,0:00:28.960
i think this one i played first got adam's game 
about being in the west i can't remember the

0:00:28.960,0:00:35.280
name of it but it was a western cowboy game and i 
graduated from those two infocomm games actually

0:00:35.280,0:00:42.800
before i worked at infocom so well how you no mine 
was more um kismet which was i broke up with that

0:00:42.800,0:00:49.120
boyfriend and he was moving to some other place 
and in kind of a so there kind of thing i said

0:00:49.120,0:00:52.480
well i'm going to move to massachusetts 
and yeah i'm going to work for infocom

0:00:53.200,0:00:59.040
completely out of the blue it was it was a just 
trying to get his goat and it sounded like fun

0:00:59.040,0:01:02.800
you know i happened to be my i had a sister in 
massachusetts so i could go mooch off her and

0:01:03.360,0:01:09.920
look you know infocom's there um and 
i got to massachusetts on a thursday

0:01:10.800,0:01:19.680
i looked in the newspaper and the want ads that 
weekend had a job for two testers at infocom one

0:01:19.680,0:01:25.920
for cornerstone stone and one for the games and 
um i applied for them and was interviewed a week

0:01:25.920,0:01:32.080
later and got the job two weeks after that and 
it was i just walked into it i didn't have to

0:01:32.960,0:01:39.440
try hard at all right the um now one of the 
things that's always hard to you you would have

0:01:39.440,0:01:45.840
been going into was it wheeler or cambridge park i 
moved i moved i started at wheeler and they moved

0:01:45.840,0:01:52.000
in my first month or two so so i got to see both 
sort of the end of the old and the beginning of

0:01:52.000,0:01:57.920
the new and i was new enough and arrived at 
a time when everything was expanding and the

0:01:57.920,0:02:01.680
excitement was all about cornerstone and how 
we're going to be business we're going to be

0:02:01.680,0:02:06.320
buttoned down we're going to be real none of 
these game things and i i got caught up in

0:02:06.320,0:02:13.360
that even though i was hired on the game side um 
and so i was all for the move and the cool new

0:02:13.360,0:02:21.840
building with the glass and the atriums and and 
um it was um i suppose it was an interesting um

0:02:23.280,0:02:28.160
not a loss of innocence so much but to see if i 
look back at myself of learning what the mistakes

0:02:28.160,0:02:33.360
were being made even as that happened i was 
able to sort of experience them myself with

0:02:33.360,0:02:39.440
with getting caught up in the excitement of of 
the new idea and then seeing how that was really

0:02:39.440,0:02:44.560
a bad idea for infocomm and then of course i ended 
up as an imp so i i moved much further into the

0:02:44.560,0:02:52.720
other side of things now it's always been kind 
of fuzzy how exactly one went from being i mean

0:02:53.840,0:02:57.760
i have a very first person narrative view of the 
whole experience you know i can't tell you what

0:02:57.760,0:03:03.360
it was like in a third-person world this was the 
first job i'd had out of college so i didn't know

0:03:03.360,0:03:07.760
at the time that it was different from anywhere 
else i mean i knew it was different but i

0:03:07.760,0:03:11.920
didn't know how different um i haven't continued 
working in the games industry so i don't know how

0:03:11.920,0:03:18.160
different it was from how games are done now you 
know so that's all i can say from my experience i

0:03:18.160,0:03:24.960
was part of the testers and we were part of the 
imps and um i don't know what it was like to be

0:03:25.600,0:03:30.000
in marketing really in in a different 
part of the same company i i can't really

0:03:31.280,0:03:35.360
talk to that experience so yes a call would go 
out we're going to get an imp but i don't know if

0:03:35.360,0:03:39.680
that was really only you know four of us knew that 
the call had gone out or if the whole company knew

0:03:39.680,0:03:43.920
that that's sort of my my thing about not being 
omniscient i don't really know what was happening

0:03:43.920,0:03:48.880
to the for the other people and i have learned 
later that apparently there was this sense of

0:03:48.880,0:03:54.480
we were the very cliquish in group the imps the 
cliquish of the clicks and the testers were on

0:03:54.480,0:04:00.080
the outer margins of that and you know moving 
out in groups but it didn't it didn't feel that

0:04:00.080,0:04:12.560
way so much to to us so from my experience um we 
had so much to to us so from my experience we had

0:04:13.520,0:04:20.960
gone through the layoffs the cornerstone disaster 
the purchase of of infocom by activision and um

0:04:23.120,0:04:28.640
steve came to me was one of his testers and he 
came to me some saturday morning and said you

0:04:28.640,0:04:33.600
know amia you i think i had told him it would be 
a goal someday to be an ampersand sort of in the

0:04:33.600,0:04:39.040
blue sky and he said you know uh we're going 
to be hiring an imp someday and someday soon

0:04:39.040,0:04:43.520
and after this hiring because of all the cup 
cutbacks and all there's not going to be another

0:04:43.520,0:04:49.440
empire until one of us dies so if you're going to 
go for it you have to go for it now so i kind of

0:04:49.440,0:04:56.400
said oh well what do i do he said well you should 
write a game so i read a game and applied and i

0:04:56.400,0:05:01.600
think there were other people applying too but 
then i got it so the the other side of this is

0:05:01.600,0:05:08.800
the testing and the m2 but then i got it so the 
the other side of this is the testing and the imps

0:05:09.440,0:05:14.800
worked very closely together so i mean it was 
a perfect springboard to become an imp because

0:05:14.800,0:05:18.400
you you knew the games and you were able to see 
how they were being created you know it wasn't

0:05:19.120,0:05:24.880
i suppose when you get a game completely done 
it's hard to imagine all of the steps that went

0:05:24.880,0:05:28.640
into creating it but when you're a tester and 
you've been there from from the alpha testing

0:05:28.640,0:05:33.280
very early stuff where nothing works and there's 
not a full story there and there's not a full

0:05:33.280,0:05:39.520
experience you have a much better sense while 
steaming out still being outside of it of of

0:05:39.520,0:05:44.960
what it's like to create it so it's it's a logical 
next step to try to do it yourself and um steve

0:05:44.960,0:05:49.840
helped me he he was the one who said you know 
here's how to do the interpreter he's had a um

0:05:50.640,0:05:54.720
oh i'm blanking on the words you know um 
compile your pro you know compile your game

0:05:54.720,0:06:00.160
just the steps to the computer side i had had some 
programming experience so that wasn't completely

0:06:00.880,0:06:08.400
out of my experience but um i didn't know how to 
do it for zil so he was able to to show me to he

0:06:08.400,0:06:14.320
didn't he did not leave me by the hand but he did 
sort of lay out what was needed in front of me so

0:06:14.320,0:06:20.640
the other side of it was lay out what was needed 
in front of me so the other side of it was um

0:06:21.600,0:06:27.680
again from my experience from within the 
whole company we were all very young i was

0:06:28.960,0:06:36.160
younger than the average but i was like 22 23. 
but but and the the guys somebody can tell you

0:06:36.160,0:06:40.400
what the average age there's a t-shirt that 
was given to the first person who would age

0:06:40.400,0:06:45.520
the oldest person the company you know so it was 
a young company we all most of us were single we

0:06:45.520,0:06:50.320
would just live there it was it was our our 
home and our family as well as our workplace

0:06:50.320,0:06:58.480
so for me to write a game i would just work 
i get into work to test you know at 9 9 30 10

0:06:59.200,0:07:05.280
i'd work till 6 30 or 7 and then i'd work on 
the game for two or three hours go out to dinner

0:07:05.280,0:07:10.080
with somebody you know else who was working 
late come back the company was open and there

0:07:10.960,0:07:15.040
all the time and then i worked all weekends when 
i was sort of actively in the mindset of i'm going

0:07:15.040,0:07:19.280
to be coming in i have to do this i was getting up 
at six in the morning and coming in saturdays and

0:07:19.280,0:07:25.200
sundays too to write my game on the weekends when 
i wasn't working but it wasn't hard it was just

0:07:25.200,0:07:30.160
part of the the whole culture of the company i was 
not alone in this is what i mean to say you'd see

0:07:30.160,0:07:35.280
other people there at the company not writing 
their own games necessarily but they're to play

0:07:35.280,0:07:42.240
games on the computers that we had available or to 
just hang out everything so um i guess in that way

0:07:44.000,0:07:46.160
it was probably different 
from other places i've worked

0:07:48.000,0:07:55.600
so um hollywood mentioned to me any specifics i 
had written a really off-the-wall bizarre little

0:07:55.600,0:08:02.960
game that came from who knows where about being a 
tester in a sort of alice in wonderland alternate

0:08:03.680,0:08:10.800
dimension and taking your your bugs which are 
real metamorphosized bugs to the imp who is like a

0:08:10.800,0:08:15.680
caterpillar at a hookah you know it was it was 
very bizarre and didn't and it esca got around

0:08:15.680,0:08:21.200
all of the um real world things of like rope so 
that my test game that i had done to prove i could

0:08:21.200,0:08:30.160
do it didn't have any warning signals um i mean 
i i would i mean i i would talk with all the guys

0:08:30.160,0:08:35.040
about i mean it was it was sort of an open 
atmosphere for some of us it was up to the

0:08:35.040,0:08:39.200
individual imp how much you wanted to share with 
the others but i would ask about puzzle problems

0:08:39.200,0:08:46.080
and and things but i don't remember any any uh 
advice on that level i know that that steve did

0:08:46.080,0:08:51.520
help me decide what to after it's hired what what 
should my first game be and i talked with it with

0:08:51.520,0:08:57.600
him about it fairly often um and i do remember him 
saying he would not have done planted hearts first

0:08:57.600,0:09:02.080
i mean before i started he said this is not what 
i do for my first game because it sounds too hard

0:09:02.080,0:09:07.840
and i didn't take his advice on that 
but um so so obviously there was um

0:09:08.640,0:09:12.720
there was mentoring and discussion going 
on but i don't remember specifics like that

0:09:13.600,0:09:24.000
i know that um moriarty you uh no i i was 
um boy i i kind of left i left the company

0:09:24.000,0:09:29.120
um i was probably a year after plenty of hearts 
came out and i had worked on some other projects

0:09:29.120,0:09:36.160
we had troubles finding a project that marketing 
and administration i'll call them wanted me to

0:09:36.160,0:09:41.680
work on um and i was very frustrated at the time 
and we don't have to go into that or we can that's

0:09:41.680,0:09:46.560
up to you but um um i was definitely i 
could have stayed and done other things

0:09:48.000,0:09:51.920
management i shouldn't say administration 
management and marketing and i could not

0:09:51.920,0:09:56.960
agree on what to do next and so management 
i shouldn't say administration management

0:09:56.960,0:10:05.120
and marketing and i could not agree on what to do 
next and some of that was the um terrified nature

0:10:05.120,0:10:11.760
of the company at that point the the downside um 
i'm just thinking of of your talking about um the

0:10:11.760,0:10:17.840
other imps talking about how wonderful it was and 
it it really was i mean i i can say for me it was

0:10:18.640,0:10:23.840
a sad truth that it was the best job i've ever had 
and a job i don't think i could ever get again it

0:10:23.840,0:10:29.120
was a really not a job it was a an amazing 
creative experience with an amazing creative

0:10:29.120,0:10:35.120
group and i do think it was something very 
special and unusual um but i can i was also there

0:10:35.120,0:10:39.840
sort of i came in at the end of the good stuff 
and i can even even say i came in at the end

0:10:39.840,0:10:46.960
of the good stuff and i know how good it was and i 
was there for most of the trajectory into into the

0:10:46.960,0:10:52.400
dissolution of the company and uh that was hard 
that was hard to go through so anyway i could

0:10:52.400,0:10:57.360
have i could have written um more games but we 
couldn't come to an agreement about what and so i

0:10:57.360,0:11:06.160
i left for some personal reasons and for some of 
that reason do you remember what um um well i they

0:11:06.160,0:11:13.360
wanted me they tasked me to come up with um a game 
that would have marketing tie-ins and my personal

0:11:13.360,0:11:22.640
interests um were geekish and not necessarily um 
going to make huge marketing tie-ins in retrospect

0:11:22.640,0:11:26.640
i think they some of them would have worked i had 
an idea for a vampire game that was roughly based

0:11:26.640,0:11:32.000
on the anne rice books which is before the movie 
had come out so it hadn't hit the mainstream yet

0:11:33.040,0:11:39.840
so that's one that i think was a mistake not to 
have let me follow up on i had an idea for an

0:11:39.840,0:11:45.280
another series of books based on our game based 
on a series of books about a swashbuckler in the

0:11:45.280,0:11:50.000
16th century that probably wouldn't have gone over 
big but it would have been another swashbuckler

0:11:50.000,0:11:54.720
um not a romance but a more historical that one 
i was a little less interested in because i'd

0:11:54.720,0:12:00.560
sort of been there done that with pointed 
hearts something similar um i had an idea

0:12:00.560,0:12:05.360
for a doctor who game but this was right at the 
end of the you know doctor who was falling into

0:12:06.080,0:12:11.760
uh not disrepair but tom baker had stopped showing 
on the on the american screens and the the new

0:12:11.760,0:12:16.560
doctors weren't as exciting and and he was never 
that huge here anyway and i don't know that that

0:12:16.560,0:12:20.480
would have been so so big either and i i should 
say it i don't know that it was all management

0:12:20.480,0:12:25.360
saying no no you can't do that it was some 
combination of me not pushing and and them not

0:12:26.000,0:12:33.040
pushing me you know it was it was a two-way street 
okay or anything else like that that was i i will

0:12:33.040,0:12:37.360
take the credit and the blame i think that was 
all my idea i mean i think they were fine with

0:12:37.360,0:12:43.280
me going forward with it and it wasn't that there 
hadn't been women writing text adventures before

0:12:45.520,0:12:49.440
even in our company though they 
hadn't been you know the main

0:12:49.440,0:12:54.000
imp but i think it was a good selling point 
of oh look and there was this movement at

0:12:54.000,0:12:58.160
that time it's before brenda laurel and 
before um i think it's purple moon which

0:12:58.160,0:13:03.200
has gone out of business now but the the games 
for girls the games that they were coming out

0:13:03.200,0:13:06.960
for girls at that time were like cooking 
games oh let's have a sewing game and which

0:13:06.960,0:13:13.760
is just benighted it just the the concept 
that and they weren't fun to play either um so

0:13:13.760,0:13:18.800
no wonder girls weren't interested in playing 
them and i'm not actually going to claim that

0:13:18.800,0:13:22.400
plundered hearts is a game that girls would be 
that interested in playing because i think the

0:13:23.200,0:13:27.840
mode of play is something that developmentally 
teenage girls aren't that interested in

0:13:27.840,0:13:32.160
doing sitting down with a computer by yourself i 
think brenda laurel and some other companies have

0:13:32.160,0:13:37.600
done good ways of getting games that girls will 
be interested in playing but we didn't know that

0:13:37.600,0:13:42.800
then and i was interested in in writing romance 
i thought a romance might be kind of fun and

0:13:42.800,0:13:47.680
different and it had this you know this gimmick 
of a woman writing for women so there were at

0:13:47.680,0:13:54.320
the time there were some uh critical reviews that 
just hated it because of its over feminists and

0:13:55.360,0:14:01.840
i remember one reviewer just lit into the game 
because she was trying to karate chop and to do

0:14:01.840,0:14:05.600
tough guy stuff and the game wouldn't let her 
and so she was criticizing it for not allowing

0:14:06.160,0:14:11.680
uh the character to be strong and we can go into a 
whole sort of philosophical approach about what a

0:14:11.680,0:14:17.040
character should be in one of these games but 
but it was it was an interesting experiment

0:14:18.240,0:14:25.520
but you know it's funny which is earlier i wanted 
to say when when asking about steve giving advice

0:14:25.520,0:14:32.720
he may not have needed to give advice because 
i had read him in a at the time i was working

0:14:32.720,0:14:37.040
there i read his an interview with him i think 
it was may have been for games magazine that

0:14:37.040,0:14:41.520
that struck me at the time and and i 
still obviously remember it today which is

0:14:41.520,0:14:45.520
he said um there's this fine line with 
with reality and what's setting up how

0:14:46.480,0:14:52.960
um the games out of the rooms are described he 
said if you if you say um you walk into an office

0:14:52.960,0:14:58.320
there's a desk there the player is going to expect 
the whole world of things that are on a typical

0:14:58.320,0:15:03.040
desk a stapler a phone you know a pencil cup who 
knows what they're going to expect and you don't

0:15:03.040,0:15:08.720
want to waste your time as a as an implementer 
coding in every single possible thing that could

0:15:08.720,0:15:13.520
possibly be on a desktop when what you really 
only care about is you know the the magic pen

0:15:13.520,0:15:22.240
that's in the pencil cup um whereas if you say you 
walk into a wizard's uh lab or a wizard's cave who

0:15:22.240,0:15:26.480
knows what's in a wizard's cave so you can get 
away with a lot by setting it in this fantasy

0:15:27.840,0:15:33.360
environment that people don't have 
predetermined expectations about what

0:15:33.360,0:15:39.120
should be in that environment um and and so i 
think that's some of what you're talking about

0:15:39.120,0:15:46.720
of at the level of the tester's job was not just 
to find bugs the rather dull qa of where does

0:15:46.720,0:15:52.000
the computer crash it's where does the world 
that you've invented break down and what is

0:15:52.000,0:15:59.600
a reasonable um approximation of things that are 
on the desk let's say that people will look for

0:16:00.640,0:16:06.400
um without having to burden the code with 
everything possible and you could argue that

0:16:06.400,0:16:10.160
in plundered hearts i didn't i didn't broaden 
it enough i didn't get enough of those because

0:16:10.160,0:16:15.600
people were complaining you can't karate chop or 
or things certainly i know i'm still embarrassed

0:16:15.600,0:16:18.880
to this day in the final released version 
there's a bug that happens in the first couple

0:16:19.680,0:16:24.160
moves when you do something very logical i can't 
remember what it is right now but it then that's

0:16:24.160,0:16:28.720
a it's a true bug you get garbage if you type 
out something like take the box there's a box

0:16:28.720,0:16:34.320
uh under the bed that slides out and if you take 
the box rather than grab the box or something

0:16:34.320,0:16:38.240
that's a logical thing to do you get garbage 
from it so that was a case where the testers

0:16:39.120,0:16:45.280
had missed or i missed in in my own i should 
take responsibility um a very obvious thing

0:16:45.280,0:16:49.840
to have done at the beginning so i don't 
know if that answers your question but

0:16:50.400,0:16:56.560
some of my questions are stories designed 
to help you remember where boy i used

0:16:57.680,0:17:03.200
a parser that was already done and i had to strip 
it way down i don't know if probably nobody's told

0:17:03.200,0:17:06.720
you my story which was they they gave me because 
it was my first game they gave me nine months to

0:17:06.720,0:17:13.760
write it and i finished it in six um and then 
spent the next three i'm just cutting stuff out

0:17:13.760,0:17:19.200
it was way way too big to fit because i was the 
last game to fit on i think it was commodore 64.

0:17:19.200,0:17:25.120
so it was all that great stuff that had to be cut 
and so i did a lot of cutting but i started with

0:17:25.120,0:17:33.920
a black box parser and i don't think i started 
with any other game i mean i could be because it

0:17:33.920,0:17:39.440
was it was a different it was coming at things 
differently if i did it would have been prison

0:17:39.440,0:17:44.480
because it was in my mind it was the most like a 
mind forever voyaging sorry which we called prison

0:17:44.480,0:17:49.040
in development um but i'm pretty sure i didn't 
because that was so huge that i would i would

0:17:49.040,0:17:52.400
have spent my first six months just cutting stuff 
out of that to make it small enough to build on

0:17:52.960,0:17:58.880
some of the games are okay i've been assigned the 
romance game no no it was very very cl i think

0:17:58.880,0:18:02.720
they would have been happier for me not to have 
done romance game first it's not like i railroaded

0:18:02.720,0:18:09.200
them into it but um i think there was there was 
definitely hey let's do something for women you

0:18:09.200,0:18:14.160
know so we can do the whole women writing for 
women we can get that whole new market because

0:18:14.160,0:18:20.160
it was definitely at the time the whole time 
i was essentially after my first uh six months

0:18:20.160,0:18:25.920
at infocomm it was all the beginning of the end 
and so there was a panic underlying everything of

0:18:26.480,0:18:31.520
where is the next hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy 
and that's uh that would be my anger is after

0:18:31.520,0:18:36.080
plundered hearts he said well that's good you know 
you didn't sell very many deer it wasn't quite

0:18:36.080,0:18:40.880
that condescending but it was almost was just go 
out and just write us another game that will sell

0:18:40.880,0:18:48.160
150 000 copies which none of the other games had 
done except for hitchhikers which was like 400 000

0:18:48.160,0:18:53.360
copies you know so it was this impossible task 
that was laid on and oh we don't want to burden

0:18:53.360,0:18:59.440
you with with telling you what to do just you just 
write us a hit and it was very frustrating for me

0:18:59.440,0:19:03.840
because i had perhaps been off more than i could 
chew with my first game in trying a different

0:19:03.840,0:19:12.880
genre and a different play a type of play for 
an entirely new um market that then you know

0:19:13.600,0:19:16.720
again this is something i don't know a lot 
about because i was kind of the innocent newbie

0:19:16.720,0:19:20.880
throughout the whole experience but from what 
i was told at the time sales didn't know what

0:19:20.880,0:19:25.120
to do with activision sales didn't know what to 
do with the infocomm game so sold to a slightly

0:19:25.120,0:19:30.480
different market a different kind of player 
it's a very different kind of play at the time

0:19:30.480,0:19:37.840
um you know sitting down for 150 hours with the 
game was not the same as pong you know so um

0:19:39.280,0:19:47.360
it was i could i could blame the lack of sales 
on things far beyond my ability to to control um

0:19:47.360,0:19:54.400
but it also probably was um being marketed to the 
wrong group and the people who would be interested

0:19:54.400,0:20:00.240
weren't interested in playing computer games so 
marketing was not unaware of that to to bring it

0:20:00.240,0:20:05.600
back to the question which is no they did not say 
here sit down you have to write a game a romance

0:20:05.600,0:20:12.800
so i think they played on that after the fact to 
have something to talk about you know about the

0:20:12.800,0:20:20.080
game but i don't even remember what else i had 
in mind for the first game i had in high school

0:20:20.080,0:20:26.080
uh thought i would write romance novels when i 
was gonna be a grown-up so so writing a romance

0:20:26.080,0:20:34.400
seemed to be a logical thing to do and something 
different but no it did not come from outside um

0:20:36.400,0:20:42.400
if i can say actually i would in retrospect uh 
when i saw pirates of the caribbean the first

0:20:42.400,0:20:48.160
movie i thought that's what i was trying to do 
that movie is what i was trying to get my game to

0:20:48.160,0:20:56.640
play like that whole experience and um wishbringer 
was the other game that i i loved the the double

0:20:56.640,0:21:00.560
layer of wishbringer of able to play it 
without magic and with magic and in the end

0:21:00.560,0:21:05.040
i didn't have any magic in the romance but that's 
sort of i should say what i was trying to do with

0:21:05.040,0:21:09.440
plundered hearts was have a way you could play 
it just as an adventure and then away as you

0:21:09.440,0:21:14.320
could play it as a as a romance steve did it more 
successfully in leather goddesses phobos i'd say

0:21:14.880,0:21:19.840
with your tongue-in-cheek romance for kind of sexy 
stuff you could do the joke of you could play it

0:21:19.840,0:21:25.280
as a straightforward game or you could play 
for all the sex jokes so anyway that's all um

0:21:27.920,0:21:32.480
i think we might have a door or seeing 
it used somewhere or anything like that

0:21:33.680,0:21:40.480
well um not immediately the the 
initial response was disappointment

0:21:41.200,0:21:46.240
i don't take that personally i think every 
game that didn't sell 150 000 at that point

0:21:47.040,0:21:52.400
was met with internally disappointment not 
not in the imps but marketing and management

0:21:52.400,0:21:59.760
were like oh no we didn't we didn't get it that 
time um go make us a hit come on do it next time

0:21:59.760,0:22:06.640
um but what was it and and given that given 
that it sold a paltry 30 000 at the time that

0:22:06.640,0:22:14.960
the average game was selling 60 000 i think 
um it was a surprise when 10 years later

0:22:16.080,0:22:22.400
i'm in graduate school in minnesota and somebody a 
high school or a college kid knocks on my door and

0:22:22.400,0:22:28.160
says are you the amy briggs i played plundered 
hearts in fifth grade it was my sister's game

0:22:28.160,0:22:33.440
but i played it with her i always make clear that 
the guys were only playing it because it was their

0:22:33.440,0:22:40.080
sister's game and that was a great experience for 
me i just want to thank you that was a surprise

0:22:40.080,0:22:46.320
to have this undercoming and not not so much i 
mean i kind of expect something from being part

0:22:46.320,0:22:51.680
of infocom um but to have apparently they're 
people who really think my game is really good

0:22:51.680,0:22:56.000
and that and and it it i wouldn't say it changed 
their lives but it made a difference in their

0:22:56.000,0:23:00.800
lives and they remembered it not as oh it's the 
failed game of that year which is sort of how

0:23:00.800,0:23:06.320
i felt about it at the time of a failed 
experiment um so that was kind of a surprise

0:23:07.440,0:23:10.960
i guess if they wanted the success of hitchhiker's 
guide they would have as you tried to work

0:23:10.960,0:23:15.760
together in a medium that's why the vampire 
thing surprised me that they didn't i think

0:23:15.760,0:23:22.720
it was um a combination of maybe me not 
pushing hard enough she was not as famous

0:23:22.720,0:23:28.320
as she is now i mean she'd only written i think 
two of the books at that point maybe three um

0:23:29.280,0:23:36.400
and that wasn't big enough um i did give pressure 
i had worked um on prairie home companion and i as

0:23:36.400,0:23:43.440
a an usher for years and new garrison i have had 
had potlucks in garrison keeler's kitchen you know

0:23:44.080,0:23:49.440
i won't say we were close personal friends but 
you know there was pressure hey see if you can get

0:23:49.440,0:23:53.600
garrison keeler and that was surprises me actually 
in retrospect because he's much much bigger now

0:23:53.600,0:23:59.440
than he was in the 80s but he at least was a name 
anne rice was still kind of this kind of culti

0:23:59.440,0:24:06.640
vampire person so so i don't know why that idea 
didn't take off more now i was assigned to the

0:24:06.640,0:24:12.080
long list of people writing um the douglas adams 
restaurant at the end of the universe that was

0:24:13.040,0:24:18.960
i don't know if that was the fir i think that 
came up when i didn't have a good uh game of

0:24:18.960,0:24:24.640
my own they said here you will write the next big 
hit because it will be the next douglas adams game

0:24:24.640,0:24:29.120
and it wasn't um it was after bureaucracy 
and it wasn't um or maybe it was the same

0:24:29.120,0:24:36.000
times bureaucracy but anyways a sequel to 
hitchhikers and a lot of imps careers died in that

0:24:36.000,0:24:45.200
in that game at the time i came on um douglas 
was completely unattached to the to the project

0:24:45.200,0:24:50.960
he just didn't want to hammer it through i never 
met him personally i stood in the room with him

0:24:50.960,0:24:56.560
once when i right after i was hired like the day 
after i started he came through and was introduced

0:24:56.560,0:25:04.160
to another tester but i wasn't on his game at that 
point so i didn't get to meet him but um so he was

0:25:04.160,0:25:10.480
not attached to the process the project and then 
it was handed off to other people and in the end i

0:25:10.480,0:25:16.640
was told seriously that i was going to be writing 
the game with a programmer at um i think it was

0:25:16.640,0:25:22.240
at magnetic scrolls a competitor's company was 
going to tell me how to write the game and then i

0:25:22.240,0:25:26.960
was just going to be the old-fashioned meaning of 
the word implementing i was just going to be doing

0:25:26.960,0:25:33.200
coding for it and i at that point i said no 
this is absurd so i i quit on that project so

0:25:34.560,0:25:40.160
you quit the project you put the company on that 
project um it was all at the same time you know

0:25:40.160,0:25:45.760
it wasn't it wasn't so it was like a standard 
breakdown that was a stan yeah that was just

0:25:45.760,0:25:51.360
the house isn't clean they didn't take care of the 
dogs doing bad at work you know what i'm getting

0:25:51.360,0:25:57.360
my back yeah i mean i can't remember the exact 
timing actually but but it was it was in the same

0:25:57.360,0:26:05.200
period so i do have historical stuff about for 
instance bureaucracy um and i mean it's it is

0:26:05.200,0:26:10.400
so that's fine i think it was panic i think 
it was panic and i think what made infocom so

0:26:10.400,0:26:19.120
great when it was great was exactly what killed 
us the um as i understand it what happened was

0:26:19.840,0:26:27.680
um they formed the company to be a button-down 
three-piece suit with vest and tie business

0:26:27.680,0:26:31.840
company but look we've got these games we'll make 
money off the games and then we'll use that for

0:26:31.840,0:26:38.240
the real stuff and they ignored the games which 
is exactly what you need for creative format for

0:26:38.240,0:26:42.720
for good stuff to happen they ignored the games 
they threw a little bit of money at us not near

0:26:42.720,0:26:48.080
as much as they should have done if we wanted to 
stay alive in the games world because that wasn't

0:26:48.080,0:26:52.880
the point then they funneled off all that money 
and put it into the the grown-up stuff and that

0:26:52.880,0:27:00.560
allowed the games people to do what they did best 
they they just sort of they were ignored and um

0:27:01.120,0:27:06.960
pleasantly neglected which allowed this group of 
really brilliant people excluding myself from that

0:27:08.160,0:27:12.800
just come together and create really wonderful 
things and a great environment i mean it was

0:27:12.800,0:27:18.320
just a really wonderful environment and then when 
cornerstone died and the end started happening

0:27:18.320,0:27:26.160
suddenly there was this need to make themselves 
a totally understandably human nature oh my gosh

0:27:26.720,0:27:32.720
we have to now survive on what we were doing 
before and make all of our hopes and dreams about

0:27:32.720,0:27:40.160
the grown-up business side now we've got to apply 
to the game side and applying a micromanagement

0:27:41.440,0:27:45.040
finger to to that side which 
is exactly what killed it

0:27:46.960,0:27:53.680
so i mean it's kind of through the neglect that 
it became was allowed to become great and then

0:27:53.680,0:27:59.600
through trying to um capitalize on that greatness 
that it killed it i think killed the the call i

0:27:59.600,0:28:04.480
don't know that the games are bad i would just 
the the late games i would just say that they're

0:28:04.480,0:28:10.480
uh they're trying too hard it's it's too much not 
let leveling go off and come up with another great

0:28:10.480,0:28:16.960
game on his own because he's done it before trust 
us you know he'll do this again it's we have to

0:28:16.960,0:28:24.080
make sure that it's going to be a win before he 
gets out of the gate which you just can't do so um

0:28:24.080,0:28:29.040
from the games industry was rather young um yeah 
i didn't plan on it it just kind of happened i

0:28:29.040,0:28:33.360
could have sort of kept thinking i'll go back 
there someday and then i realized it had moved

0:28:33.360,0:28:41.760
on without me yeah i didn't i retired in 20 when 
i was 26 and i was like why to write yes i keep

0:28:41.760,0:28:47.200
doing that i've done that periodically in my life 
i'm going to write the great american novel and um

0:28:48.160,0:28:55.200
uh actually that was a mistake i was going to 
just write a novel and they had this huge party

0:28:55.200,0:28:59.760
for me when i left infocomm and they gave 
me a t-shirt which i still have which was

0:28:59.760,0:29:08.160
the 1989 winner of the pulitzer prize which 
suddenly put these expectations on it that um kind

0:29:08.160,0:29:15.200
of killed that in the bud so oh did you actually 
take that actually stunt your interest in it or

0:29:15.200,0:29:20.560
i'm still interested in it and i'm still kind of 
trying to do it but i've never written that novel

0:29:20.560,0:29:24.960
no i keep finding other things to do so i wonder 
if i really do want to write the novel if i just

0:29:24.960,0:29:31.200
want to keep dreaming about writing the novel well 
that's something to be said for that um so let's

0:29:31.200,0:29:35.840
see what i'm going to do yep so because by that 
point wheeler's probably already starting to be in

0:29:36.400,0:29:43.200
wheeler when i first saw it was already in boxes 
yeah it was a dark little place full of boxes so

0:29:43.920,0:29:49.920
um i'll start talking about the imp life but 
i could also probably talk about the testers

0:29:49.920,0:29:54.880
the the building is still around today i think 
and i think it's six stories tall and we were on

0:29:54.880,0:30:00.400
the fifth floor and it was um what is now i'm 
sure very dated all glass on the outside with

0:30:01.120,0:30:07.440
quite beautiful glass atriums from from bottom 
to top in the middle and it was all very

0:30:07.440,0:30:13.920
buttoned down so you'd arrive i'd arrive whenever 
i felt like getting up and i was i was um

0:30:13.920,0:30:18.960
living in oh gosh i lived all over boston at 
that time but i was living on the tea so it

0:30:18.960,0:30:26.320
was an easy tea trip out and then just a walk of 
three blocks over to cambridge park and you go

0:30:26.320,0:30:31.840
up the elevator and you're surrounded by you know 
button-down places you walk in we've got a formal

0:30:31.840,0:30:38.880
reception area and everything's kind of light 
and um i should say uh colorless not not light

0:30:38.880,0:30:44.880
in a good way it's all colorless and there's gray 
carpet and there's white walls and there's no uh

0:30:44.880,0:30:49.440
the thing wheeler had going for it is it even 
though when i knew it it was dark in in boxes

0:30:49.440,0:30:53.680
there was a sense of actual artisanship there i 
i don't actually know if it was just a rundown

0:30:54.400,0:31:00.080
place but that was the feeling of it there 
was no artisan ship at cambridge park and um

0:31:01.200,0:31:08.000
it was we were we took up like half the floor 
around one atrium and it was all divided up

0:31:08.000,0:31:12.160
with the because when we moved in we were going to 
take over the whole floor and i have some memory

0:31:12.160,0:31:17.600
that maybe we even did rent the whole floor for a 
while and then they in the cutbacks they got rid

0:31:17.600,0:31:25.200
of some of the space but it was largely empty so 
we had a you'd walk into reception with marketing

0:31:26.000,0:31:31.280
and then beyond that into you you go geez you can 
go to the right and go to the imps go to the left

0:31:31.280,0:31:35.280
and you get to the testing area and go further to 
the left and around the building you'd be where

0:31:35.280,0:31:41.600
the they developed the parser and tim anderson 
and the the the guys who i considered the um the

0:31:41.600,0:31:46.320
real programmers work i misspoke not the parser 
the interpreters were written over there and then

0:31:46.880,0:31:52.880
administration the big guys were down the 
hall by themselves in a corner and the the

0:31:52.880,0:31:57.840
imps area has probably been described we we had 
what we call the bowling alley it was a very

0:31:57.840,0:32:03.360
large open room with windows at the end and was 
on the corner of the building so all of the imps

0:32:03.360,0:32:08.640
on the north side had windows in their offices 
with john palace on the corner and then a big

0:32:09.600,0:32:15.440
series of windows for the bowling alley and 
then a line of offices on the south side with

0:32:15.440,0:32:22.640
steve moritzki had the south side windowed office 
and then the rest of us had the closed-in offices

0:32:23.200,0:32:27.920
on the south side and we did talk about the north 
side kids and the southside kids and the north

0:32:27.920,0:32:33.200
side were the real programmers and the south side 
were the just the dabblers who had the creative

0:32:33.200,0:32:37.120
ability and were struggling with the programming 
that that was the myth because of course steve

0:32:37.120,0:32:42.080
was on the south side but he wasn't considered 
one of the real programmers and he didn't have a

0:32:42.080,0:32:48.640
computer science degree but um he definitely in 
that deserved to be on the north side i think

0:32:48.640,0:32:53.760
he kind of enjoyed being on the south side so 
the south side was me jeff o'neal and hollywood

0:32:53.760,0:32:59.920
who actually was not on the south side it was on 
the east side but it was also a windowless office

0:33:00.640,0:33:08.880
um i think the intent had been to um when we 
got up and running and were famous assuming they

0:33:08.880,0:33:13.040
even were going to have games that there would be 
cubicles in the center of that big area and then

0:33:13.040,0:33:21.760
we'd have games just routing out our ears from all 
the people working all at once so um you'd show up

0:33:21.760,0:33:27.520
when you'd ch you'd show up when you'd show up 
i don't remember ever being rushed and i'm not a

0:33:27.520,0:33:36.160
morning person so i don't think it was an early 
time um i would um the doors were always open

0:33:36.880,0:33:45.360
except in few cases when people didn't want 
to be bothered but it was actually a really

0:33:45.360,0:33:50.880
wonderful way to work all of the imps we were 
all working on our own projects separately but

0:33:50.880,0:33:56.640
in a shared environment and and for me it was a it 
was a great it was kind of the perfect environment

0:33:56.640,0:34:01.120
because you have the team the sense of we're all 
working together on something but i didn't have

0:34:01.120,0:34:06.320
to share my work with anybody else there was no 
need to actually work with partners other people

0:34:06.320,0:34:13.680
work well with partners i don't but i had the the 
team support without the individual butting in

0:34:16.000,0:34:24.800
you would say hi you would say hi you'd sit down 
i would work on a good day i would forget the time

0:34:24.800,0:34:30.080
it passed and i kind of come into myself 
six hours later realizing i'd forgotten

0:34:31.040,0:34:36.640
to have lunch we worked on old-fashioned 
amber monitors plugged into a mainframe it's

0:34:36.640,0:34:42.080
kind of hard to even remember how basic 
it felt very high tech at the time but

0:34:42.080,0:34:50.080
you know it's nothing like you know the cheapest 
computer out today um the day would end uh around

0:34:50.080,0:34:57.360
separate time the formal day um frequently with 
a a boggle party or not party but a boggle game

0:34:58.000,0:35:02.480
which gosh i wish i could get this probably 
available now but for many years it was not

0:35:02.480,0:35:09.040
possible to have an intranet boggle game so we we 
would all be playing it would be whoever signed up

0:35:09.040,0:35:15.520
usually imps and testers playing boggle on 
the computer for half an hour or so and then

0:35:15.520,0:35:20.000
some people would go home if they had families 
they would go home to the families others of us

0:35:20.000,0:35:28.160
would stay and work later um steve by the way 
was by far the best boggle player and i always

0:35:28.160,0:35:33.120
thought that i was a poor player because steve 
would beat the pants off me and everybody else

0:35:34.240,0:35:37.600
partly just because he's the fastest typist 
i've ever known so you could think of the word

0:35:37.600,0:35:42.800
it would already be typed out for him i have since 
discovered that i have not been beaten by anybody

0:35:42.800,0:35:50.480
in boggle ever since i lost or left infocom so i 
guess i'm pretty good too but steve was supreme

0:35:54.560,0:35:58.560
every week one day a week 
we'd have a an imps lunch

0:35:59.840,0:36:05.920
where we would get together and formally 
officially share how the game was going bring

0:36:05.920,0:36:12.240
up problems ask for help tom snyder productions 
would come to those other other outside groups

0:36:12.240,0:36:19.280
um above bates when he was sort of working for us 
but not yet part of the group would come to those

0:36:19.280,0:36:25.680
lunches they were they were semi-formal i think 
bruce what's his name the head of activision came

0:36:25.680,0:36:33.040
to one of them um and doesn't ring a bell bruce 
is what we called him the lawyer the ceo yeah

0:36:33.040,0:36:40.560
yeah so who hated infocus yeah he came to one of 
those lunches and that was a tense lunch um but

0:36:40.560,0:36:46.480
those were and i i i guess you know i was the 
girl i was the one who ran out to get the food

0:36:47.360,0:36:52.000
john and me john and i would share that and i 
still don't think that that was because i was the

0:36:52.000,0:36:57.200
girl i got paid less than anybody else but i don't 
think it was because i was the girl it was because

0:36:57.200,0:37:02.800
i was the last hired in that group and i was 
told before i started you know we're paying the

0:37:02.800,0:37:07.280
other guys a lot more than you but we just don't 
have the money now now maybe if i had not been a

0:37:07.280,0:37:14.880
girl they wouldn't have cut that way i don't i 
don't hold it against them whoever they might

0:37:14.880,0:37:19.680
be but it was the true fact that i was the one who 
would get the lunches and i was the one who would

0:37:20.960,0:37:26.560
frequently got the friday party supplies too but i 
also kind of like to do that so i would volunteer

0:37:27.360,0:37:35.840
um and at the i like to do that so i would 
volunteer um and at the ims lunches it was um

0:37:36.800,0:37:43.200
you know it was a supportive atmosphere i don't 
recall i mean i know there must have been fights

0:37:43.200,0:37:47.520
um between imps and i know that there were 
fights between imps but i don't recall

0:37:48.240,0:37:54.720
anything at these lunches um among us except 
sort of supportive geez you know i've got

0:37:55.440,0:38:01.760
a puzzle i can't figure out how to solve it it's 
boring how do we solve this puzzle or how do i we

0:38:01.760,0:38:06.400
didn't do coding questions because sitting around 
a lunch table is not a good place to do coding

0:38:06.960,0:38:13.040
uh problem solving so that wasn't the kind of 
thing we discussed that you'd walk over to stu

0:38:13.040,0:38:17.680
stu galley is usually the person i'd check 
in with depended what what you were looking

0:38:17.680,0:38:24.960
for stu was the person i go to for parser 
stuff leveling for um really complex stuff

0:38:24.960,0:38:31.120
in programming um steve for real questions for 
comedy you know how to make something funny

0:38:32.000,0:38:39.120
or just how to get out of a pickle in the story 
um and then at the imp lunches it was all just a

0:38:39.120,0:38:47.440
free-for-all of people talking and suggesting 
so that would pretty much be how how it would

0:38:47.440,0:38:52.160
work it was everybody working on their own thing 
but together and it worked pretty well that way

0:38:53.200,0:38:58.960
so um and of course a couple people were 
remote but that's the way those things are

0:38:59.520,0:39:06.000
um because it's it's the cover it's on the 
cover the marketing interviews you the game um

0:39:06.960,0:39:11.600
the game packaging when i was it's changed 
from all the wonderful unique packaging to the

0:39:11.600,0:39:16.800
the look of a matching set of books i mean it fits 
in with that that was very very definitely the

0:39:16.800,0:39:26.560
perception and the perception um from within that 
yeah we really were the best and and it's arrogant

0:39:26.560,0:39:32.640
i suppose but maybe it's true i don't know 
we certainly have been remembered well um

0:39:33.360,0:39:39.200
so we didn't need to we were above all the 
we weren't doing just games we were doing

0:39:39.200,0:39:46.960
experiences environments and they were more like 
books that's how we saw them um you know so yeah

0:39:46.960,0:39:50.720
we would not have any way of knowing but 
you know and you want them to know right um

0:39:53.920,0:40:00.240
i'm not sure i can say i think of infocau the 
theme song in the back of my head is camelot

0:40:00.240,0:40:06.320
camelot which i can't sing right now but um 
it was kind of this moment of glory and it's

0:40:06.320,0:40:10.960
not to say that it couldn't happen again 
i look at the games coming out now which i

0:40:10.960,0:40:16.880
don't look at too closely i'm not big into 
games um but i don't know i think some of what

0:40:17.760,0:40:24.400
made infocom so great was this um individual 
vision that they were able to that the the

0:40:24.400,0:40:29.200
style of the game and the ability with a text 
adventure it's you know it's it is a book

0:40:29.200,0:40:34.640
i'll i'll go strongly it is a book just done a 
little differently you get an individual vision

0:40:34.640,0:40:40.960
in a different way than you do when you're having 
to hire voice uh what do they call voice actors

0:40:40.960,0:40:46.160
you know mark hamill has to be in this and we've 
got to have graphics and we got to have certain

0:40:46.160,0:40:52.880
algorithms for the fight scenes and things i i 
just it doesn't surprise me that many of the games

0:40:52.880,0:40:58.800
the commercial games today are more and more like 
sort of um absent hollywood movies it's because

0:40:58.800,0:41:03.600
it's the only way you can make something that 
looks like that and um i i do think it's kind

0:41:03.600,0:41:07.760
of amazing the the underground amateur games 
that there are maybe they aren't underground

0:41:07.760,0:41:12.400
to people who are there but um because 
my my response is why would i want to

0:41:13.920,0:41:18.560
it's an unlearned response i want to say this 
is not educated it's it's why would i want to

0:41:18.560,0:41:23.760
commit to 100 hours of playing some unknowns game 
i want i want the stamp of somebody put some money

0:41:23.760,0:41:29.600
behind this you know i have to pay for this to 
make it worthwhile to prove that it's good but

0:41:29.600,0:41:34.560
probably those games are as engaging as 
any other book that's written today and

0:41:35.120,0:41:40.000
i would think probably for me and the kind 
of interests i have more engaging than halo

0:41:42.000,0:41:48.640
so it's not quite fair to compare halo with 
flooded hearts but anyway so i don't know

0:41:48.640,0:41:54.080
that i have anything to say that hasn't been said 
by other people or isn't well known there's a lot

0:41:54.080,0:41:59.760
less shooting in blood regards than halo there is 
though there are a lot of deaths in blended hearts

0:41:59.760,0:42:04.880
and that was there's a lot less shooting in 
blended hearts than halo there is though there

0:42:04.880,0:42:09.680
are a lot of deaths in blended hearts and that was 
strictly because i was trying to keep it easy on

0:42:09.680,0:42:15.680
the idea that um it was supposed to be this new 
market of people who hadn't played and i didn't

0:42:15.680,0:42:20.960
have a good way of making the puzzles easier 
more better hints or something so i just have you

0:42:21.520,0:42:28.160
die before and it was to make it easy you just 
die so that i didn't have to get a puzzle to get

0:42:28.160,0:42:32.640
out of whatever it was and also i didn't have 
the space because i was so cramped for space

0:42:32.640,0:42:37.360
it was easier to die than to have a landing 
room that you know if you step off the cliff or

0:42:37.360,0:42:44.560
something apropos very specific uh point about 
blended hearts i like the phrase landing room

0:42:44.560,0:42:47.600
see that's a good example of someone who 
has an implementation in their background
