0:00:00.480,0:00:06.720
Um, well, I they wanted me ... they tasked 
me to come up with a game that

0:00:06.720,0:00:13.680
would have marketing tie-ins and my personal 
interests were geekish and not necessarily

0:00:13.680,0:00:19.600
 going to make huge marketing tie-ins. In 
retrospect, I think they some of them would

0:00:19.600,0:00:23.680
have worked. I had an idea for a vampire game 
that was roughly based on the Anne Rice books,

0:00:23.680,0:00:28.880
which is before the movie had come out. Um 
so it hadn't hit the mainstream yet. Um,

0:00:28.880,0:00:33.920
so that's one that I think was a mistake 
not to have let me follow up on. Um,

0:00:33.920,0:00:39.840
I had an idea for an another series of books based 
on or a game based on a series of books about a

0:00:39.840,0:00:44.160
swashbuckler in the 16th century. That probably 
wouldn't have gone over big, but it would have

0:00:44.160,0:00:49.520
been another swashbuckler. Um, not a romance, 
but a more historical. That one I was a little

0:00:49.520,0:00:53.600
less interested in because I'd sort of been there, 
done that with Plundered Heart, something similar.

0:00:53.600,0:00:59.920
Um, I had an idea for a Doctor Who game, but 
this was right at the end of the, you know,

0:00:59.920,0:01:06.000
Doctor Who was falling into not disrepair, 
but Tom Baker had stopped showing on the on the

0:01:06.000,0:01:10.880
American screens and the new doctors weren't 
as exciting and and he was never that huge here

0:01:10.880,0:01:15.440
anyway. And I don't know that that would have been 
so so big either. And I should say it's I don't

0:01:15.440,0:01:19.280
know that it was all management saying, "No, no, 
no, you can't do that." It was some combination

0:01:19.280,0:01:24.480
of me not pushing and and them not pushing 
me. You know, it was a two-way street.
