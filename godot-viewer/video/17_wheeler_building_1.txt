Wheeler when I first saw it was already in boxes. 
Yeah, it was a dark little place full of boxes.

0:00:06.640,0:00:13.520
So, I'll start talking about the imp life, but 
I could also probably talk about the testers. The

0:00:13.520,0:00:18.640
the the building is still around today, I think, 
and I think it's six stories tall and we were on

0:00:18.640,0:00:24.800
the fifth floor and it was what is now, I'm 
sure, very dated. all glass on the outside with

0:00:24.800,0:00:31.040
quite beautiful glass atriums from from bottom 
to top in the middle and it was all very

0:00:31.040,0:00:37.360
 buttoned down. So, you'd arrive I'd arrive 
whenever I felt like getting up and I was I was

0:00:37.360,0:00:42.640
 living in oh gosh I lived all over Boston 
at that time, but I was living on the tea. So,

0:00:42.640,0:00:49.040
it was an easy tea trip out and then just a 
walk of three blocks over to Cambridge Park

0:00:49.040,0:00:54.720
and you go up the elevator and you're surrounded 
by, you know, button-down places. You walk in,

0:00:54.720,0:00:59.040
we've got a formal reception area 
and everything's kind of light and

0:00:59.040,0:01:05.200
 I should say uh colorless. Not not light in 
a good way. It's all colorless and there's gray

0:01:05.200,0:01:10.880
carpet and there's white walls and there's no uh 
the thing Wheeler had going for it is it it even

0:01:10.880,0:01:15.440
though when I knew it it was dark and in boxes, 
there was a sense of actual artisanship there.

0:01:15.440,0:01:20.000
I don't actually know if it was just a rundown 
place, but that was the feeling of it. There was

0:01:20.000,0:01:28.960
no artisanship at Cambridge Park and it 
was we we were we took up like half the floor

0:01:28.960,0:01:33.600
around one atrium and it was all divided up with 
the 'cuz when we moved in we were going to take

0:01:33.600,0:01:38.240
over the whole floor and I have some memory that 
maybe we even did rent the whole floor for a while

0:01:38.240,0:01:44.480
and then they in the cutbacks they got rid of 
some of the space but it was largely empty. Um,
