0:00:00.080,0:00:08.000
So the other side of it was again from my 
experience from within the whole company

0:00:08.000,0:00:14.720
we were all very young. I was younger than 
the average, but I was like 22, 23. Um,

0:00:14.720,0:00:20.080
but but and the guys, somebody can tell you 
what the average age, there's a t-shirt that

0:00:20.080,0:00:23.920
was given to the first person who would age, 
the oldest person in the company, you know. So,

0:00:23.920,0:00:29.280
it was a young company. We all, most of us were 
single. We would just live there. It was

0:00:29.280,0:00:35.360
our our home and our family as well as our 
workplace. So, for me to write a game,

0:00:35.360,0:00:42.720
I would just work. I' get into work to test, you 
know, at 9:00, 9:30, 10:00. I'd work till 6:30

0:00:42.720,0:00:48.400
or 7:00 and then I'd work on the game for 2 or 3 
hours. Go out to dinner with somebody, you know,

0:00:48.400,0:00:54.160
else who was working late, come back. The company 
was open and there all the time. And then I worked

0:00:54.160,0:00:57.760
all weekends when I was sort of actively in 
the mindset of I'm going to be coming in.

0:00:57.760,0:01:01.760
I have to do this. I was getting up at six in the 
morning and coming in Saturdays and Sundays, too,

0:01:01.760,0:01:06.640
to to write my game on the on the weekends 
when I wasn't working. But it wasn't hard.

0:01:06.640,0:01:11.120
It was just part of the whole culture of 
the company. I was not alone in this is what

0:01:11.120,0:01:14.960
I mean to say. You'd see other people there at the 
company, not writing their own games necessarily,

0:01:14.960,0:01:22.800
but there to play games on the computers that we 
had available or to just hang out, everything. So,

0:01:22.800,0:01:28.560
 I guess in that way, it was probably 
different from other places I've worked.
