0:00:00.160,0:00:09.120
Right. Um I'm not sure I can say I think of Infoc. 
theme song in the back of my head is Camelot.

0:00:09.120,0:00:14.880
Camelot, which I can't sing right now, but 
 it was kind of this moment of glory.

0:00:14.880,0:00:19.040
And it's not to say that it couldn't happen 
again. I look at the games coming out now,

0:00:19.040,0:00:25.040
which I don't look at too closely. I'm not 
big into games. Um but I don't know. I think

0:00:25.040,0:00:32.640
some of what made Infocom so great was this
individual vision that they were able to that

0:00:32.640,0:00:37.520
the style of the game and the ability with 
a text adventure. It's you know it's it is a

0:00:37.520,0:00:43.200
book. I'll I'll go strongly. It is a book just 
done a little differently. You get an individual

0:00:43.200,0:00:49.360
vision in a different way than you do when you're 
having to hire voice uh what do they call voice

0:00:49.360,0:00:54.400
actors. you know, Mark Hamill has to be in this 
and we got to have graphics and we got to have

0:00:54.400,0:01:00.000
 certain algorithms for the fight scenes 
and things. I just it doesn't surprise me

0:01:00.000,0:01:06.240
that many of the games, the commercial games 
today are more and more like sort of absent

0:01:06.240,0:01:10.720
Hollywood movies. It's because it's the only way 
you can make something that looks like that. And

0:01:10.720,0:01:15.760
 I do think it's kind of amazing the 
underground amateur games that there are. Maybe

0:01:15.760,0:01:21.120
they aren't underground to people who are there, 
but because my my response is why would I want

0:01:21.120,0:01:27.280
to it's an an unlearned response. I want to say 
this is not educated. It's it's why would I want

0:01:27.280,0:01:32.080
to commit to 100 hours of playing some unknowns 
game. I want I want the stamp of somebody

0:01:32.080,0:01:36.080
put some money behind this. You know, I have 
to pay for this to make it worthwhile to prove

0:01:36.080,0:01:43.280
that it's good. Um but probably those games are as 
engaging as any other book that's written today.

0:01:43.280,0:01:50.800
And I would think probably for me and the kind 
of interests I have more engaging than Halo. Um,

0:01:50.800,0:01:56.080
so it's it's not quite fair to compare 
Halo with Plundered Hearts, but anyway.
