though there are a lot of deaths in Plundered 
Hearts and that was strictly because I was

0:00:04.880,0:00:09.760
trying to keep it easy on the idea that um it 
was supposed to be this new market of people

0:00:09.760,0:00:15.680
who hadn't played and I didn't have a good 
way of making the puzzles easier better hints

0:00:15.680,0:00:21.600
or something. So I just have you die before 
and it was to make it easy. You just die so

0:00:21.600,0:00:26.960
that I didn't have to get a puzzle to get out of 
whatever it was. And also I didn't have the space

0:00:26.960,0:00:32.320
cuz I was so crammed for space. It was easier to 
die than to have a landing room that you know if

0:00:32.320,0:00:38.480
you step off the cliff or something apppropo 
very specific uh point about planet hearts.
