0:00:00.320,0:00:04.240
I have a very first person narrative view of 
the whole experience. Yeah, I can't tell you

0:00:04.240,0:00:09.280
what it was like in a third person world. This 
was the first job I'd had out of college, so I

0:00:09.280,0:00:14.080
didn't know at the time that it was different from 
anywhere else. I mean, I knew it was different,

0:00:14.080,0:00:17.840
but I didn't know how different. Um, I haven't 
continued working in the games industry, so I

0:00:17.840,0:00:23.440
don't know how different it was from how games are 
done now, you know. So, that's all I can say. Um,

0:00:23.440,0:00:30.720
from my experience, I was part of the testers and 
we were part of the imps and um, I don't know what

0:00:30.720,0:00:35.760
it was like to be uh, in marketing really in 
in a different part of the same company. I I

0:00:35.760,0:00:41.440
I can't really talk to that experience. So, yes, 
a call would go out. We're going to get an imp.

0:00:41.440,0:00:44.880
But I don't know if that was really only, you 
know, four of us knew that the call had gone

0:00:44.880,0:00:49.200
out or if the whole company knew that. That's 
sort of my my thing about not being omnisient.

0:00:49.200,0:00:53.600
I don't really know what was happening to the 
for the other people and I have learned later

0:00:53.600,0:00:58.800
that apparently there was this sense of we were 
the very clickish in group the imp the clickish

0:00:58.800,0:01:04.800
of the clicks and the testers were on the outer 
margins of that and you know moving out in groups

0:01:04.800,0:01:13.920
um but it didn't it didn't feel that way so much 
to to us. So from my experience um we had um gone

0:01:13.920,0:01:21.120
through the layoffs the cornerstone disaster 
the purchase of of infoccom by Activision and

0:01:21.120,0:01:28.800
um uh Steve came to me. I was one of his testers 
and he came to me some Saturday morning and said

0:01:28.800,0:01:33.360
you know Amy you I I think I had told him it 
would be a goal someday to be an imperson. It

0:01:33.360,0:01:36.800
was sort of in the blue sky. And he said, 
you know, uh, we're going to be hiring an

0:01:36.800,0:01:42.400
imp someday and someday soon. And after this 
hiring, because of all the cutbacks and all,

0:01:42.400,0:01:46.800
um, there's not going to be another imp hired 
until one of us dies. So, if you're going to go

0:01:46.800,0:01:51.520
for it, you have to go for it now. So, I kind of 
said, "Oh, well, what do I do?" He said, "Well,

0:01:51.520,0:01:57.360
you should write a game." So, I read a game and 
applied. And I think there were other people

0:01:57.360,0:02:04.160
applying, too. But then I got it. So the the 
other side of this is the testing and the imps

0:02:04.160,0:02:09.600
worked very closely together. So I mean it was a 
perfect springboard to become an imp because you

0:02:09.600,0:02:14.320
you knew the games and you were able to see how 
they were being created. You know it wasn't I I

0:02:14.320,0:02:19.840
suppose when you get a game completely done it's 
hard to imagine all of the steps that went into

0:02:19.840,0:02:23.840
creating it. But when you're a tester and you've 
been there from from the alpha testing, very early

0:02:23.840,0:02:29.440
stuff where nothing works and there's not a full 
story there and there's not a full experience,

0:02:29.440,0:02:34.960
you have a much better sense while steaming out 
still being outside of it of of what it's like to

0:02:34.960,0:02:39.840
create it. So it's a it's a logical next step 
to try to do it yourself. And um Steve helped

0:02:39.840,0:02:45.600
me. He he was the one who said, you know, here's 
how to do the interpreter. Here's how to um Oh,

0:02:45.600,0:02:49.920
I'm blanking on the words, you know, um compile 
your pro, you know, compile your game. just the

0:02:49.920,0:02:55.520
steps to the the computer side. I had had some 
programming experience, so that wasn't completely

0:02:55.520,0:03:03.120
out of my experience, but um I didn't know how to 
do it for ZIL. So, he was able to to show me to he

0:03:03.120,0:03:08.000
didn't he did not leave me by the hand, but he did 
sort of lay out what was needed in front of me.
