0:00:00.080,0:00:07.760
Uh, that's why the vampire things surprised me 
that they didn't I think it was a combination

0:00:07.760,0:00:12.240
of maybe me not pushing hard enough. She was 
not as famous as she is now. I mean, she'd only

0:00:12.240,0:00:20.240
written I think two of the books at that point, 
maybe three. Um, and that wasn't big enough. Um,

0:00:20.240,0:00:27.440
I did get pressure. I had worked on pray home 
companion and I as a an usher for years and knew

0:00:27.440,0:00:33.440
Garrison have had had potlucks in Garrison 
Keeler's kitchen you know I won't say we were

0:00:33.440,0:00:38.480
close personal friends but you know there was 
pressure hey see if you can get Garrison Keeler

0:00:38.480,0:00:42.560
and that was surprises me actually in retrospect 
because he's much much bigger now than he was in

0:00:42.560,0:00:48.640
the 80s but he at least was a name, Ann Rice 
was still kind of this kind of culty vampire

0:00:48.640,0:00:55.040
person so so I don't know why that idea didn't 
take off more. Now I was assigned to the long

0:00:55.040,0:01:01.360
list of people writing the Douglas Adams or 
Sunstone at the end of the universe. That was I

0:01:01.360,0:01:07.680
don't know if that was the first I think that came 
up when I didn't have a good game of my own.

0:01:07.680,0:01:12.800
They said here you will write the next big hit 
because it will be the next Douglas Adams game.

0:01:12.800,0:01:17.280
And it wasn't it was after Bureaucracy 
and it wasn't or maybe it was the same

0:01:17.280,0:01:24.000
time as Bureaucracy but anyway it was a sequel to 
Hitchhiker's and a lot of imps careers died in that

0:01:24.000,0:01:33.920
in that game. At the time I came on Douglas was 
completely unattached to the to the project. Um he

0:01:33.920,0:01:39.120
just didn't want to hammer it through. I never 
met him personally. I stood in the room with him

0:01:39.120,0:01:44.720
once when I right after I was hired like the day 
after I started he came through and was introduced

0:01:44.720,0:01:49.840
to another tester but I wasn't on his game 
at that point so I didn't get to meet him but

0:01:49.840,0:01:56.240
 so he was not attached to the process the 
project and then it was handed off to other

0:01:56.240,0:02:03.520
people and in the end I was told seriously that I 
was going to be writing the game with a programmer

0:02:03.520,0:02:09.280
at I think it was at magnetic scrolls a 
competitor's company was going to tell me how to

0:02:09.280,0:02:13.920
write the game and that I was just going to be
the oldfashioned meaning of the word implementing.

0:02:13.920,0:02:19.200
I was just going to be doing coding for it. And I 
at that point I said, "No, this is absurd." So I

0:02:19.200,0:02:27.840
quit on that project. So it was all at the same 
time, you know, it wasn't So - it was So - that was

0:02:27.840,0:02:32.720
like a standard breakup. That was a stand- "Yeah, 
that was just the house isn't clean. You didn't

0:02:32.720,0:02:37.600
take care of the dogs. I'm doing bad at work. 
You know what? I'm getting my back". Yeah. I mean,

0:02:37.600,0:02:42.960
I can't remember the exact timing actually, but 
Okay. But it was in the same period.
