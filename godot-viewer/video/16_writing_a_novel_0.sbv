Yeah, I didn't plan on it. It just kind of 
happened. I could sort of kept thinking, well,

0:00:03.600,0:00:09.120
I'll go back there someday. And then I realized 
it had moved on without me. I keep doing that.

0:00:09.120,0:00:14.080
I've done that periodically in my life. I'm 
going to write the great American novel. And

0:00:14.080,0:00:21.440
um uh actually that that was a mistake. I was 
going to just write a novel. And they had this

0:00:21.440,0:00:26.560
huge party for me when I left Infocom and they 
gave me a t-shirt which I still have which was

0:00:26.560,0:00:33.920
the 1989 winner of the Pulitzer Prize which 
suddenly put these expectations on it that

0:00:33.920,0:00:39.040
um kind of killed that in the bud. 
So I'm still interested in it and

0:00:39.040,0:00:43.600
I'm still kind of trying to do it but 
I've never written that novel. No,

0:00:43.600,0:00:47.120
I keep finding other things to do. So I wonder 
if I really do want to write the novel or if

0:00:47.120,0:00:50.880
I just want to keep dreaming about writing the 
novel. There was something to be said for that.
