If if I can say actually I would in retrospect 
uh, when I saw Pirates of the Caribbean the first

0:00:06.960,0:00:12.320
movie I thought that's what I was trying to do 
that movie is what I was trying to get my game

0:00:12.320,0:00:21.200
to play like that whole experience and Wishbringer
was the other game that I loved the double

0:00:21.200,0:00:25.440
layer of Wishbringer of able to play it without 
magic and with magic and in the end I didn't

0:00:25.440,0:00:29.840
have any magic in the romance but that's sort of 
I should say what I was trying to do with Plunder

0:00:29.840,0:00:34.640
Ed hearts was have a way you could play it just as 
an adventure and then a way you could play it as

0:00:34.640,0:00:39.840
a as a romance. Steve did it more successfully 
in Leather Goddesses of Phobos. I'd say if you

0:00:39.840,0:00:44.560
tongue-in-cheek romance for kind of sexy stuff, 
you could do the joke of you could play it as a

0:00:44.560,0:00:49.200
straightforward game or you could play it for 
all the sex jokes. So anyway, that's all.
