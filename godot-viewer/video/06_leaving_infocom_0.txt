0:00:00.080,0:00:08.880
I was boy I kind of left I left the company 
 oh it was probably a year after Plundered

0:00:08.880,0:00:15.040
Hearts came out and I had worked on some other 
projects. We had troubles finding a project that

0:00:15.040,0:00:21.280
 marketing and administration I'll call them 
wanted me to work on. Um, and I was very frustrated

0:00:21.280,0:00:27.440
at the time and we don't have to go into that or 
we can that's up to you but I was definitely

0:00:27.440,0:00:32.320
I could have stayed and done other things.
Management, I shouldn't say administration,

0:00:32.320,0:00:38.400
management and marketing and I could not agree 
on what to do next and some of that was the

0:00:38.400,0:00:46.160
 terrified nature of the company at that point, 
the the downside. Um I'm just thinking of of your

0:00:46.160,0:00:51.760
talking about the other imps talking about how 
wonderful it was and it it really was. I mean,

0:00:51.760,0:00:58.640
I can say for me it was a sad truth that it was 
the best job I've ever had and and a job I don't

0:00:58.640,0:01:04.080
think I could ever get again. It was a really not 
a job. It was a an amazing creative experience

0:01:04.080,0:01:09.440
with an amazing creative group and I do think 
it was something very special and unusual. Um,

0:01:09.440,0:01:14.640
but I can I was also there sort of I came in at 
the end of the good stuff and I can even even

0:01:14.640,0:01:19.440
say I came in at the end of the good stuff and I 
know how good it was and I was there for most of

0:01:19.440,0:01:26.960
the trajectory into into the dissolution of the 
company and uh that was hard that was hard to

0:01:26.960,0:01:31.840
go through. So anyway, I could have I could have 
written more games, but we couldn't come to an

0:01:31.840,0:01:37.760
agreement about what. And so I left for some 
personal reasons and for some of that reason.
