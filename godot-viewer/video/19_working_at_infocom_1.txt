You would say hi. You'd sit down. I would work. On 
a good day, I would forget the time had passed

0:00:07.840,0:00:15.360
and I kind of come into myself 6 hours later 
realizing I'd forgotten to have lunch. Um we

0:00:15.360,0:00:20.000
worked on old-fashioned amber monitors plugged 
into a main frame. It's kind of hard to even

0:00:20.000,0:00:26.000
remember how basic. It felt very high-tech at the 
time, but you know, it was nothing like, you know,

0:00:26.000,0:00:35.280
the cheapest computer out today. Um the day 
would end uh around separate time, the formal day

0:00:35.280,0:00:42.480
 frequently with a a bogggle party or not party 
but a bogggle game which gosh I wish I could get

0:00:42.480,0:00:47.840
this probably available now but for many years 
it was not possible to have an intranet bogggle

0:00:47.840,0:00:53.360
game. So we we would all be playing it would be 
whoever signed up usually impssons and testers

0:00:53.360,0:01:00.000
 playing Boggle on the computer for half an hour 
or so and then some people would go home if they

0:01:00.000,0:01:06.720
had families they would go home to the families 
others of us would stay and work later. Um, Steve,

0:01:06.720,0:01:12.640
by the way, was by far the best Boggle player. 
And I always thought that I was a poor player. Um,

0:01:12.640,0:01:17.680
because Steve would beat the pants off me and 
everybody else. Um, partly just cuz he's the

0:01:17.680,0:01:21.200
fastest typist I've ever known. So, you could 
think of the word and it would already be typed

0:01:21.200,0:01:26.160
out for him. Um, I have since discovered that 
I have not been beaten by anybody in Bogle

0:01:26.160,0:01:33.120
ever since I lost or left Infocom. So, I guess 
I'm pretty good, too. But Steve was supreme.
