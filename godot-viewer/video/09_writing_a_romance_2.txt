0:00:00.400,0:00:06.240
Um earlier I wanted to say when when asking 
about um Steve giving advice, he may not have

0:00:06.240,0:00:13.680
needed to give advice because I had read him in 
a at the time I was working there. I read his

0:00:13.680,0:00:18.160
an interview with him. I think it was may have 
been for Games Magazine that that struck me at

0:00:18.160,0:00:23.360
the time and and I still obviously remember it 
today which is he said um there's this fine line

0:00:23.360,0:00:29.680
with with reality and with setting up how um the 
games how the the rooms are described. He said,

0:00:29.680,0:00:35.600
"If you if you say um you walk into an office, 
there's a desk there. The player is going to

0:00:35.600,0:00:40.160
expect the whole world of things that are on 
a typical desk, a stapler, a phone, you know,

0:00:40.160,0:00:43.680
a pencil cup. Who knows what they're going 
to expect?" And you don't want to waste your

0:00:43.680,0:00:50.080
time as a as an implementer coding in every single 
possible thing that could possibly be on a desktop

0:00:50.080,0:00:54.880
when what you really only care about is, you 
know, the the magic pen that's in the pencil cup.

0:00:54.880,0:01:02.720
Um whereas if you say you walk into a wizard's 
uh lab or a wizard's cave, who knows what's in

0:01:02.720,0:01:08.800
a wizard's cave. So you can get away with a lot 
by setting it in this fantasy at uh environment

0:01:08.800,0:01:15.680
that people don't have predetermined expectations 
about what should be in that environment. Um and

0:01:15.680,0:01:21.200
and so I I think that's some of what you're 
talking about of of um at the level of the

0:01:21.200,0:01:28.320
ters's job was not just to find bugs. the rather 
dull QA of where does the computer crash. It's

0:01:28.320,0:01:35.040
where does the world that you've invented break 
down and what is a reasonable um approximation

0:01:35.040,0:01:42.960
of things that are on the desk. Let's say that 
people will look for um without having to burden

0:01:42.960,0:01:47.600
the code with everything possible. And um you 
could argue that in Plundered Hearts I didn't I

0:01:47.600,0:01:51.440
didn't broaden it enough. I didn't get enough of 
those because people were complaining you can't

0:01:51.440,0:01:56.480
karate chop or or things. Um, certainly I know 
I'm still embarrassed to this day in the final

0:01:56.480,0:02:01.520
released version there's a bug that happens in 
the first couple moves u when you do something

0:02:01.520,0:02:05.120
very logical and I can't remember what it is 
right now but it then that's a it's a true bug.

0:02:05.120,0:02:10.640
You get garbage if you type out something like 
take the box there's a box uh under the bed that

0:02:10.640,0:02:15.280
slides out and if you take the box rather than 
grab the box or something that's a logical thing

0:02:15.280,0:02:21.520
to do you get garbage from it. So that was a case 
where the testers um had missed or I missed in in

0:02:21.520,0:02:26.640
my own I should take responsibility um a very 
obvious thing to have done at the beginning.
