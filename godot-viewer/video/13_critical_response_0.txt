Well, not immediately. the initial 
response, was disappointment. Um,

0:00:08.240,0:00:14.560
I don't take that personally. I think every game 
that didn't sell 150,000 at that point was met

0:00:14.560,0:00:19.760
with internally disappointment. Not not in the 
imps, but marketing and management were like,

0:00:19.760,0:00:28.400
"Oh, darn. We didn't we didn't get it that time. 
Um, go make us a hit. Come on, do it next time."

0:00:28.400,0:00:33.680
uh, but what was it and given that
it sold a poultry 30,000 at the time that

0:00:33.680,0:00:44.160
the average game was selling 60,000, I think it 
was a surprise when 10 years later, I'm in graduate

0:00:44.160,0:00:49.920
school in Minnesota, and somebody a high school 
or a college kid knocks on my door and says are

0:00:49.920,0:00:55.760
you THE Amy Briggs? I played "Plundered Hearts" in 
fifth grade. It was my sister's game, but I played

0:00:55.760,0:01:01.360
it with her. I always make clear that the guys 
were only playing it 'cuz it was their sister's

0:01:01.360,0:01:07.040
 game. Um, and that was a great experience for 
me. I just want to thank you. That was a surprise

0:01:07.040,0:01:13.360
to have this undercoming and not not so much. I 
mean, I kind of expect something from being part

0:01:13.360,0:01:18.640
of Infocom. Um, but to have apparently there are 
people who really think my game is really good

0:01:18.640,0:01:23.040
and that and and it it I wouldn't say it changed 
their lives, but it it made a difference in their

0:01:23.040,0:01:27.360
lives and they remembered it not as oh it's 
the failed game of that year, which is sort

0:01:27.360,0:01:33.600
of how I felt about it at the time of a failed 
experiment. Um, so that was kind of a surprise.
