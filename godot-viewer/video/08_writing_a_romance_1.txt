0:00:00.240,0:00:05.200
That was I will take the credit and the blame. 
I think that was all my idea. I mean, I think they

0:00:05.200,0:00:11.120
were fine with me going forward with it. And it 
wasn't that there hadn't been women writing text

0:00:11.120,0:00:19.520
adventures before. Um, even in our company, though 
they hadn't been, you know, the main imp. Um,

0:00:19.520,0:00:23.120
but I think it was a good selling point of, oh, 
look, and there was this movement at that time.

0:00:23.120,0:00:27.920
is before Brenda Laurel and before I think it's 
Purple Moon, which has gone out of business now,

0:00:27.920,0:00:33.360
but the games for girls, the games that they 
were coming out for girls at that time were like

0:00:33.360,0:00:38.800
cooking games. Oh, let's have a sewing game and 
which is just benited. It it just the concept

0:00:38.800,0:00:43.840
that and they weren't fun to play either. 
Um so, no wonder girls weren't interested

0:00:43.840,0:00:49.440
in playing them. I'm not actually going to claim 
that Plundered Hearts is a game that girls would

0:00:49.440,0:00:54.480
be that interested in playing because I think the 
mode of play is something that developmentally

0:00:54.480,0:00:59.040
teenage girls aren't that interested in doing 
sitting down with a computer by yourself. I

0:00:59.040,0:01:04.320
think Brenda Laurel and some other companies have 
done good ways of of getting games that girls will

0:01:04.320,0:01:09.600
be interested in playing. But we didn't know that 
then. And I was interested in in writing romance.

0:01:09.600,0:01:13.760
I thought a romance might be kind of fun and 
different. And it had this, you know, this gimmick

0:01:13.760,0:01:19.600
of a woman writing for women. So there were at the 
time there were some critical reviews that just

0:01:19.600,0:01:27.680
hated it because of its over femininess. And 
 I remember one reviewer just lit into the

0:01:27.680,0:01:32.400
game because she was trying to karate chop and to 
do tough guy stuff and the game wouldn't let her.

0:01:32.400,0:01:38.400
And so she was criticizing it for not allowing 
uh the character to be strong. And we can go

0:01:38.400,0:01:42.320
into a whole sort of philosophical approach about 
what a character should be in one of these games.
