0:00:00.240,0:00:08.400
Um, every week, uh, one day a week, we'd have a 
an imps lunch, where we would get together

0:00:08.400,0:00:15.520
and formally officially share how the game was 
going, bring up problems, ask for help. Um,

0:00:15.520,0:00:21.280
Tom Snyder Productions would come to those, you 
know, other other outside groups. Um, Bob Bates

0:00:21.280,0:00:27.280
when he was sort of working for us but not yet 
part of the group would come to those lunches.

0:00:27.280,0:00:33.200
They were they were semiformmal I think Bruce 
what's his name the head of Activision came to

0:00:33.200,0:00:42.320
one of them Br... It doesn't ring a bell... Bruce 
is what the CEO - yeah - so when paid info yeah he

0:00:42.320,0:00:49.520
came to one of those lunches and that was a tense 
lunch but those were and I guess you know

0:00:49.520,0:00:55.200
I was the girl I was the one who ran out to get 
the food John and me John and I would share that

0:00:55.200,0:01:00.400
and I still don't think that that was because 
I was the girl. I got paid less than anybody

0:01:00.400,0:01:04.720
else. But I don't think it was because I was the 
girl. It was because I was the last hired in that

0:01:04.720,0:01:10.000
group and I was told before I started, you know, 
we're paying the other guys a lot more than you,

0:01:10.000,0:01:16.080
but we just don't have the money now. Now, maybe 
if I had not been a girl, they wouldn't have cut

0:01:16.080,0:01:22.480
that way. I don't I don't hold it against them, 
whoever they might be, but it was the true fact

0:01:22.480,0:01:27.520
that I was the one who would get the lunches 
and I was the one who would frequently

0:01:27.520,0:01:32.960
got the Friday party supplies, too. But I also 
kind of like to do that, so I would volunteer.
