0:00:00.080,0:00:07.040
Um, I had written a really off-the-wall, bizarre 
little game that came from who knows where about

0:00:07.040,0:00:14.160
being a tester in a sort of Alice in Wonderland 
alternate dimension and taking your your bugs,

0:00:14.160,0:00:20.080
which are real metamorphosized bugs, to the imp 
who was like a caterpillar at a hookah. you know,

0:00:20.080,0:00:26.240
it was it was very bizarre and didn't and it esc 
got around all of the real world things of like

0:00:26.240,0:00:30.960
rope so that my test game that I had done to sort 
of prove I could do it didn't have any warning

0:00:30.960,0:00:39.040
signals. Um, I mean, I would talk with all of the 
guys about I mean it was it was sort of an open

0:00:39.040,0:00:42.640
atmosphere for some of us. So, it was up to the 
individual imp how much he wanted to share with

0:00:42.640,0:00:48.720
the others, but I would ask about puzzle problems 
and and things, but I don't remember any any

0:00:48.720,0:00:54.160
uh advice on that level. I know that that Steve 
did help me decide what to after I was hired,

0:00:54.160,0:01:00.080
what what should my first game be, and I talked 
with it with him about it fairly often. Um,

0:01:00.080,0:01:03.680
and I do remember him saying he would not 
have done Plundered Hearts first. I mean,

0:01:03.680,0:01:07.200
before I started, he said, "This is not what 
I do for my first game because it sounds too

0:01:07.200,0:01:12.800
hard." and I didn't take his advice on 
that. But so so obviously there was

0:01:12.800,0:01:18.720
 there was mentoring and discussion going 
on, but I don't remember specifics like that.
