the game the game packaging when I was it's 
changed from all the wonderful unique packaging

0:00:06.240,0:00:11.360
to the the look of a matching set of books. 
I mean it it fits in with that. That was very

0:00:11.360,0:00:20.240
very definitely the perception and the perception 
 from within that yeah we really were the best

0:00:20.240,0:00:26.480
and and it's arrogant I suppose but maybe it's 
true. I don't know. Uh we certainly have been

0:00:26.480,0:00:33.760
remembered well. Um, so we didn't need to. We We 
were above all the We weren't doing just games. We

0:00:33.760,0:00:38.560
were doing experiences, environments, and they
