I think it was panic. I think it was panic. And 
I think what made Infocom so great when it was

0:00:04.880,0:00:14.400
great was exactly what killed us. The as I 
understand it, what happened was they formed

0:00:14.400,0:00:22.800
the company to be a button-down threepiece suit 
with vest and tie business company, but look,

0:00:22.800,0:00:26.640
we've got these games. We'll make money off the 
games and then we'll use that for the real stuff.

0:00:26.640,0:00:32.800
and they ignored the games, which is exactly what 
you need for creative fment for for good stuff to

0:00:32.800,0:00:37.440
happen. They ignored the games. They threw a 
little bit of money at us, not near as much as

0:00:37.440,0:00:42.080
they should have done if we wanted to stay alive 
in the games world because that wasn't the point.

0:00:42.080,0:00:47.200
Then they funneled off all that money and put it 
into the grown-up stuff. And that allowed the

0:00:47.200,0:00:55.440
games people to do what they did best. they they 
just sort of they were ignored and pleasantly

0:00:55.440,0:01:01.520
neglected which allowed this group of really 
brilliant people excluding myself from that

0:01:01.520,0:01:06.720
 just come together and create really wonderful 
things and a great environment. I mean it was just

0:01:06.720,0:01:12.080
a really wonderful environment and then when 
Cornerstone died and the end started happening

0:01:12.080,0:01:20.480
suddenly there was this need to make themselves a 
totally understandably human nature. Oh my gosh,

0:01:20.480,0:01:26.400
we have to now survive on what we were doing 
before and make all of our hopes and dreams about

0:01:26.400,0:01:34.720
the grown-up business side. Now we've got to apply 
to the game side and applying a micromanagement

0:01:34.720,0:01:42.960
uh finger to to that side, which is exactly 
what killed it. Um, so I mean it's kind of

0:01:42.960,0:01:49.440
through the neglect that it became was allowed 
to become great and then through trying to

0:01:49.440,0:01:53.600
 capitalize on that greatness that it killed 
it. I think killed the qual I don't know

0:01:53.600,0:01:58.320
that the games are bad. I would just the 
late games. I would just say that they're

0:01:58.320,0:02:04.160
uh they're trying too hard. It's it's too much not 
let leveling go off and come up with another great

0:02:04.160,0:02:10.560
game on his own 'cuz he's done it before. trust 
us, you know, he'll do this again. It's we have

0:02:10.560,0:02:15.360
to make sure that it's going to be a win before 
he gets out of the gate, which you just can't do.
