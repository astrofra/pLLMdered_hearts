0:00:00.240,0:00:04.720
No, no, it was very very clear. I think they 
would have been happier for me not to have done

0:00:04.720,0:00:10.720
Romance game first. It's not like I railroaded 
them into it. But I think there was there

0:00:10.720,0:00:15.760
was definitely hey let's do something for women, 
you know, so we can do the whole women writing for

0:00:15.760,0:00:20.880
women. We can get that whole new market 'cuz it 
was definitely at the time the whole time I was

0:00:20.880,0:00:27.200
essentially after my first six months at 
Infocom, it was all the beginning of the end.

0:00:27.200,0:00:32.240
And so there was a panic underlying everything of 
"where is the next Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ?"

0:00:32.240,0:00:37.120
and that's that would be my anger is after 
Plundered Hearts. He said, "Well, that's good.

0:00:37.120,0:00:41.040
You know, you didn't sell very many, dear." It 
it wasn't quite that condescending, but it was

0:00:41.040,0:00:48.160
almost was "just go out and just write us another 
game that will sell 150,000 copies", which none of

0:00:48.160,0:00:53.440
the other games had done except for Hitchhogers, 
which still like 400,000 copies, you know. So,

0:00:53.440,0:00:58.240
it was this impossible task that was laid on 
and oh, we don't want to burden you with with

0:00:58.240,0:01:03.920
telling you what to do. Just you just write us a 
hit. And it was very frustrating for me because I

0:01:03.920,0:01:08.800
had perhaps bitten off more than I could chew with 
my first game and trying a different genre and...

0:01:08.800,0:01:18.080
...a different play, a type of play for an entirely 
new market that then, you know, again, this

0:01:18.080,0:01:21.440
is something I don't know a lot about cuz I was 
kind of the innocent newbie throughout the whole

0:01:21.440,0:01:26.560
experience. But from what I was told at the time, 
sales didn't know what to do with Activision sales

0:01:26.560,0:01:30.240
didn't know what to do with the Infocom games. are 
sold to a slightly different market, a different

0:01:30.240,0:01:36.160
kind of player. Um, it's a very different kind 
of play at the time. Um, you know, sitting down

0:01:36.160,0:01:45.040
for 100, 150 hours with the game was not the same 
as Pong, you know. So, it was I could I could

0:01:45.040,0:01:53.520
blame the lack of sales on things far beyond my 
ability to to control. Um but it also probably was

0:01:53.520,0:01:58.800
 being marketed to the wrong group and 
the people who would been interested weren't

0:01:58.800,0:02:04.880
interested in playing computer games. So marketing 
was not unaware of that to to bring it back to the

0:02:04.880,0:02:10.720
question which is no they did not say here sit 
down you have to write a game a romance.

0:02:10.720,0:02:17.440
So, I think they played on that after the fact to have 
something to talk about, you know, about the game,

0:02:17.440,0:02:24.320
but I don't even remember what else I had in mind 
for the first game. Um, I had in high school uh

0:02:24.320,0:02:30.080
thought I would write romance novels when I was 
going to be a grown-up. So, so writing a romance

0:02:30.080,0:02:37.120
seemed to be a a logical thing to do and something 
different. But no, it did not come from outside.
