WEBVTT

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.840
oh yeah i mean that's that's easy that's an easy
question i um was in college i had a boyfriend

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.440
who was ahead of the game and he actually sold
computers it's in the early 80s so he was ahead

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.000
i had he was a geek like most of the people i
like and um he introduced me we would stay up

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.040
late playing tax adventure games so the first
one i played actually was a scott adams game

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.960
i think this one i played first got adam's game
about being in the west i can't remember the

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.280
name of it but it was a western cowboy game and i
graduated from those two infocomm games actually

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.800
before i worked at infocom so well how you no mine
was more um kismet which was i broke up with that

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.120
boyfriend and he was moving to some other place
and in kind of a so there kind of thing i said

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.480
well i'm going to move to massachusetts
and yeah i'm going to work for infocom

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.040
completely out of the blue it was it was a just
trying to get his goat and it sounded like fun

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.800
you know i happened to be my i had a sister in
massachusetts so i could go mooch off her and

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.920
look you know infocom's there um and
i got to massachusetts on a thursday

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:19.680
i looked in the newspaper and the want ads that
weekend had a job for two testers at infocom one

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.920
for cornerstone stone and one for the games and
um i applied for them and was interviewed a week

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.080
later and got the job two weeks after that and
it was i just walked into it i didn't have to

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.440
try hard at all right the um now one of the
things that's always hard to you you would have

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.840
been going into was it wheeler or cambridge park i
moved i moved i started at wheeler and they moved

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.000
in my first month or two so so i got to see both
sort of the end of the old and the beginning of

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.920
the new and i was new enough and arrived at
a time when everything was expanding and the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.680
excitement was all about cornerstone and how
we're going to be business we're going to be

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.320
buttoned down we're going to be real none of
these game things and i i got caught up in

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.360
that even though i was hired on the game side um
and so i was all for the move and the cool new

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:21.840
building with the glass and the atriums and and
um it was um i suppose it was an interesting um

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.160
not a loss of innocence so much but to see if i
look back at myself of learning what the mistakes

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.360
were being made even as that happened i was
able to sort of experience them myself with

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.440
with getting caught up in the excitement of of
the new idea and then seeing how that was really

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.560
a bad idea for infocomm and then of course i ended
up as an imp so i i moved much further into the

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:52.720
other side of things now it's always been kind
of fuzzy how exactly one went from being i mean

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.760
i have a very first person narrative view of the
whole experience you know i can't tell you what

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.360
it was like in a third-person world this was the
first job i'd had out of college so i didn't know

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.760
at the time that it was different from anywhere
else i mean i knew it was different but i

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.920
didn't know how different um i haven't continued
working in the games industry so i don't know how

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.160
different it was from how games are done now you
know so that's all i can say from my experience i

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.960
was part of the testers and we were part of the
imps and um i don't know what it was like to be

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.000
in marketing really in in a different
part of the same company i i can't really

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.360
talk to that experience so yes a call would go
out we're going to get an imp but i don't know if

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.680
that was really only you know four of us knew that
the call had gone out or if the whole company knew

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.920
that that's sort of my my thing about not being
omniscient i don't really know what was happening

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.880
to the for the other people and i have learned
later that apparently there was this sense of

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.480
we were the very cliquish in group the imps the
cliquish of the clicks and the testers were on

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.080
the outer margins of that and you know moving
out in groups but it didn't it didn't feel that

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:12.560
way so much to to us so from my experience um we
had so much to to us so from my experience we had

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.960
gone through the layoffs the cornerstone disaster
the purchase of of infocom by activision and um

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.640
steve came to me was one of his testers and he
came to me some saturday morning and said you

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.600
know amia you i think i had told him it would be
a goal someday to be an ampersand sort of in the

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.040
blue sky and he said you know uh we're going
to be hiring an imp someday and someday soon

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.520
and after this hiring because of all the cup
cutbacks and all there's not going to be another

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.440
empire until one of us dies so if you're going to
go for it you have to go for it now so i kind of

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.400
said oh well what do i do he said well you should
write a game so i read a game and applied and i

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.600
think there were other people applying too but
then i got it so the the other side of this is

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.800
the testing and the m2 but then i got it so the
the other side of this is the testing and the imps

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.800
worked very closely together so i mean it was
a perfect springboard to become an imp because

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.400
you you knew the games and you were able to see
how they were being created you know it wasn't

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.880
i suppose when you get a game completely done
it's hard to imagine all of the steps that went

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.640
into creating it but when you're a tester and
you've been there from from the alpha testing

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.280
very early stuff where nothing works and there's
not a full story there and there's not a full

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.520
experience you have a much better sense while
steaming out still being outside of it of of

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.960
what it's like to create it so it's it's a logical
next step to try to do it yourself and um steve

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.840
helped me he he was the one who said you know
here's how to do the interpreter he's had a um

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.720
oh i'm blanking on the words you know um
compile your pro you know compile your game

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.160
just the steps to the computer side i had had some
programming experience so that wasn't completely

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:08.400
out of my experience but um i didn't know how to
do it for zil so he was able to to show me to he

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.320
didn't he did not leave me by the hand but he did
sort of lay out what was needed in front of me so

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.640
the other side of it was lay out what was needed
in front of me so the other side of it was um

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.680
again from my experience from within the
whole company we were all very young i was

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:36.160
younger than the average but i was like 22 23.
but but and the the guys somebody can tell you

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.400
what the average age there's a t-shirt that
was given to the first person who would age

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.520
the oldest person the company you know so it was
a young company we all most of us were single we

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.320
would just live there it was it was our our
home and our family as well as our workplace

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:58.480
so for me to write a game i would just work
i get into work to test you know at 9 9 30 10

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:05.280
i'd work till 6 30 or 7 and then i'd work on
the game for two or three hours go out to dinner

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.080
with somebody you know else who was working
late come back the company was open and there

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.040
all the time and then i worked all weekends when
i was sort of actively in the mindset of i'm going

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.280
to be coming in i have to do this i was getting up
at six in the morning and coming in saturdays and

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:25.200
sundays too to write my game on the weekends when
i wasn't working but it wasn't hard it was just

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.160
part of the the whole culture of the company i was
not alone in this is what i mean to say you'd see

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.280
other people there at the company not writing
their own games necessarily but they're to play

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:42.240
games on the computers that we had available or to
just hang out everything so um i guess in that way

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.160
it was probably different
from other places i've worked

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.600
so um hollywood mentioned to me any specifics i
had written a really off-the-wall bizarre little

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:02.960
game that came from who knows where about being a
tester in a sort of alice in wonderland alternate

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:10.800
dimension and taking your your bugs which are
real metamorphosized bugs to the imp who is like a

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.680
caterpillar at a hookah you know it was it was
very bizarre and didn't and it esca got around

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:21.200
all of the um real world things of like rope so
that my test game that i had done to prove i could

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:30.160
do it didn't have any warning signals um i mean
i i would i mean i i would talk with all the guys

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.040
about i mean it was it was sort of an open
atmosphere for some of us it was up to the

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.200
individual imp how much you wanted to share with
the others but i would ask about puzzle problems

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:46.080
and and things but i don't remember any any uh
advice on that level i know that that steve did

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:51.520
help me decide what to after it's hired what what
should my first game be and i talked with it with

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:57.600
him about it fairly often um and i do remember him
saying he would not have done planted hearts first

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:02.080
i mean before i started he said this is not what
i do for my first game because it sounds too hard

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.840
and i didn't take his advice on that
but um so so obviously there was um

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.720
there was mentoring and discussion going
on but i don't remember specifics like that

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:24.000
i know that um moriarty you uh no i i was
um boy i i kind of left i left the company

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.120
um i was probably a year after plenty of hearts
came out and i had worked on some other projects

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:36.160
we had troubles finding a project that marketing
and administration i'll call them wanted me to

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.680
work on um and i was very frustrated at the time
and we don't have to go into that or we can that's

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.560
up to you but um um i was definitely i
could have stayed and done other things

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.920
management i shouldn't say administration
management and marketing and i could not

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.960
agree on what to do next and so management
i shouldn't say administration management

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:05.120
and marketing and i could not agree on what to do
next and some of that was the um terrified nature

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:11.760
of the company at that point the the downside um
i'm just thinking of of your talking about um the

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:17.840
other imps talking about how wonderful it was and
it it really was i mean i i can say for me it was

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.840
a sad truth that it was the best job i've ever had
and a job i don't think i could ever get again it

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:29.120
was a really not a job it was a an amazing
creative experience with an amazing creative

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:35.120
group and i do think it was something very
special and unusual um but i can i was also there

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.840
sort of i came in at the end of the good stuff
and i can even even say i came in at the end

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:46.960
of the good stuff and i know how good it was and i
was there for most of the trajectory into into the

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:52.400
dissolution of the company and uh that was hard
that was hard to go through so anyway i could

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:57.360
have i could have written um more games but we
couldn't come to an agreement about what and so i

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:06.160
i left for some personal reasons and for some of
that reason do you remember what um um well i they

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:13.360
wanted me they tasked me to come up with um a game
that would have marketing tie-ins and my personal

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:22.640
interests um were geekish and not necessarily um
going to make huge marketing tie-ins in retrospect

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.640
i think they some of them would have worked i had
an idea for a vampire game that was roughly based

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:32.000
on the anne rice books which is before the movie
had come out so it hadn't hit the mainstream yet

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:39.840
so that's one that i think was a mistake not to
have let me follow up on i had an idea for an

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:45.280
another series of books based on our game based
on a series of books about a swashbuckler in the

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.000
16th century that probably wouldn't have gone over
big but it would have been another swashbuckler

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.720
um not a romance but a more historical that one
i was a little less interested in because i'd

00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.560
sort of been there done that with pointed
hearts something similar um i had an idea

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.360
for a doctor who game but this was right at the
end of the you know doctor who was falling into

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:11.760
uh not disrepair but tom baker had stopped showing
on the on the american screens and the the new

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.560
doctors weren't as exciting and and he was never
that huge here anyway and i don't know that that

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.480
would have been so so big either and i i should
say it i don't know that it was all management

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.360
saying no no you can't do that it was some
combination of me not pushing and and them not

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.040
pushing me you know it was it was a two-way street
okay or anything else like that that was i i will

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.360
take the credit and the blame i think that was
all my idea i mean i think they were fine with

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:43.280
me going forward with it and it wasn't that there
hadn't been women writing text adventures before

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.440
even in our company though they
hadn't been you know the main

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.000
imp but i think it was a good selling point
of oh look and there was this movement at

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.160
that time it's before brenda laurel and
before um i think it's purple moon which

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:03.200
has gone out of business now but the the games
for girls the games that they were coming out

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.960
for girls at that time were like cooking
games oh let's have a sewing game and which

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:13.760
is just benighted it just the the concept
that and they weren't fun to play either um so

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.800
no wonder girls weren't interested in playing
them and i'm not actually going to claim that

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.400
plundered hearts is a game that girls would be
that interested in playing because i think the

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.840
mode of play is something that developmentally
teenage girls aren't that interested in

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.160
doing sitting down with a computer by yourself i
think brenda laurel and some other companies have

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:37.600
done good ways of getting games that girls will
be interested in playing but we didn't know that

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.800
then and i was interested in in writing romance
i thought a romance might be kind of fun and

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.680
different and it had this you know this gimmick
of a woman writing for women so there were at

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:54.320
the time there were some uh critical reviews that
just hated it because of its over feminists and

00:13:55.360 --> 00:14:01.840
i remember one reviewer just lit into the game
because she was trying to karate chop and to do

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.600
tough guy stuff and the game wouldn't let her
and so she was criticizing it for not allowing

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.680
uh the character to be strong and we can go into a
whole sort of philosophical approach about what a

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:17.040
character should be in one of these games but
but it was it was an interesting experiment

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:25.520
but you know it's funny which is earlier i wanted
to say when when asking about steve giving advice

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:32.720
he may not have needed to give advice because
i had read him in a at the time i was working

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.040
there i read his an interview with him i think
it was may have been for games magazine that

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.520
that struck me at the time and and i
still obviously remember it today which is

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:45.520
he said um there's this fine line with
with reality and what's setting up how

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:52.960
um the games out of the rooms are described he
said if you if you say um you walk into an office

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:58.320
there's a desk there the player is going to expect
the whole world of things that are on a typical

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:03.040
desk a stapler a phone you know a pencil cup who
knows what they're going to expect and you don't

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:08.720
want to waste your time as a as an implementer
coding in every single possible thing that could

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.520
possibly be on a desktop when what you really
only care about is you know the the magic pen

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:22.240
that's in the pencil cup um whereas if you say you
walk into a wizard's uh lab or a wizard's cave who

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.480
knows what's in a wizard's cave so you can get
away with a lot by setting it in this fantasy

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:33.360
environment that people don't have
predetermined expectations about what

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:39.120
should be in that environment um and and so i
think that's some of what you're talking about

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:46.720
of at the level of the tester's job was not just
to find bugs the rather dull qa of where does

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:52.000
the computer crash it's where does the world
that you've invented break down and what is

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.600
a reasonable um approximation of things that are
on the desk let's say that people will look for

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:06.400
um without having to burden the code with
everything possible and you could argue that

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.160
in plundered hearts i didn't i didn't broaden
it enough i didn't get enough of those because

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:15.600
people were complaining you can't karate chop or
or things certainly i know i'm still embarrassed

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.880
to this day in the final released version
there's a bug that happens in the first couple

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.160
moves when you do something very logical i can't
remember what it is right now but it then that's

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.720
a it's a true bug you get garbage if you type
out something like take the box there's a box

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:34.320
uh under the bed that slides out and if you take
the box rather than grab the box or something

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.240
that's a logical thing to do you get garbage
from it so that was a case where the testers

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:45.280
had missed or i missed in in my own i should
take responsibility um a very obvious thing

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.840
to have done at the beginning so i don't
know if that answers your question but

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:56.560
some of my questions are stories designed
to help you remember where boy i used

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:03.200
a parser that was already done and i had to strip
it way down i don't know if probably nobody's told

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.720
you my story which was they they gave me because
it was my first game they gave me nine months to

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:13.760
write it and i finished it in six um and then
spent the next three i'm just cutting stuff out

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:19.200
it was way way too big to fit because i was the
last game to fit on i think it was commodore 64.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:25.120
so it was all that great stuff that had to be cut
and so i did a lot of cutting but i started with

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:33.920
a black box parser and i don't think i started
with any other game i mean i could be because it

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:39.440
was it was a different it was coming at things
differently if i did it would have been prison

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.480
because it was in my mind it was the most like a
mind forever voyaging sorry which we called prison

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.040
in development um but i'm pretty sure i didn't
because that was so huge that i would i would

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.400
have spent my first six months just cutting stuff
out of that to make it small enough to build on

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:58.880
some of the games are okay i've been assigned the
romance game no no it was very very cl i think

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.720
they would have been happier for me not to have
done romance game first it's not like i railroaded

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:09.200
them into it but um i think there was there was
definitely hey let's do something for women you

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.160
know so we can do the whole women writing for
women we can get that whole new market because

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:20.160
it was definitely at the time the whole time
i was essentially after my first uh six months

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:25.920
at infocomm it was all the beginning of the end
and so there was a panic underlying everything of

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.520
where is the next hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
and that's uh that would be my anger is after

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.080
plundered hearts he said well that's good you know
you didn't sell very many deer it wasn't quite

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.880
that condescending but it was almost was just go
out and just write us another game that will sell

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:48.160
150 000 copies which none of the other games had
done except for hitchhikers which was like 400 000

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:53.360
copies you know so it was this impossible task
that was laid on and oh we don't want to burden

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:59.440
you with with telling you what to do just you just
write us a hit and it was very frustrating for me

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.840
because i had perhaps been off more than i could
chew with my first game in trying a different

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:12.880
genre and a different play a type of play for
an entirely new um market that then you know

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.720
again this is something i don't know a lot
about because i was kind of the innocent newbie

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.880
throughout the whole experience but from what
i was told at the time sales didn't know what

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.120
to do with activision sales didn't know what to
do with the infocomm game so sold to a slightly

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:30.480
different market a different kind of player
it's a very different kind of play at the time

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:37.840
um you know sitting down for 150 hours with the
game was not the same as pong you know so um

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:47.360
it was i could i could blame the lack of sales
on things far beyond my ability to to control um

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:54.400
but it also probably was um being marketed to the
wrong group and the people who would be interested

00:19:54.400 --> 00:20:00.240
weren't interested in playing computer games so
marketing was not unaware of that to to bring it

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:05.600
back to the question which is no they did not say
here sit down you have to write a game a romance

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:12.800
so i think they played on that after the fact to
have something to talk about you know about the

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:20.080
game but i don't even remember what else i had
in mind for the first game i had in high school

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:26.080
uh thought i would write romance novels when i
was gonna be a grown-up so so writing a romance

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:34.400
seemed to be a logical thing to do and something
different but no it did not come from outside um

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:42.400
if i can say actually i would in retrospect uh
when i saw pirates of the caribbean the first

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:48.160
movie i thought that's what i was trying to do
that movie is what i was trying to get my game to

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:56.640
play like that whole experience and um wishbringer
was the other game that i i loved the the double

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.560
layer of wishbringer of able to play it
without magic and with magic and in the end

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:05.040
i didn't have any magic in the romance but that's
sort of i should say what i was trying to do with

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.440
plundered hearts was have a way you could play
it just as an adventure and then away as you

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:14.320
could play it as a as a romance steve did it more
successfully in leather goddesses phobos i'd say

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.840
with your tongue-in-cheek romance for kind of sexy
stuff you could do the joke of you could play it

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:25.280
as a straightforward game or you could play
for all the sex jokes so anyway that's all um

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.480
i think we might have a door or seeing
it used somewhere or anything like that

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:40.480
well um not immediately the the
initial response was disappointment

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.240
i don't take that personally i think every
game that didn't sell 150 000 at that point

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:52.400
was met with internally disappointment not
not in the imps but marketing and management

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:59.760
were like oh no we didn't we didn't get it that
time um go make us a hit come on do it next time

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:06.640
um but what was it and and given that given
that it sold a paltry 30 000 at the time that

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:14.960
the average game was selling 60 000 i think
um it was a surprise when 10 years later

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:22.400
i'm in graduate school in minnesota and somebody a
high school or a college kid knocks on my door and

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:28.160
says are you the amy briggs i played plundered
hearts in fifth grade it was my sister's game

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:33.440
but i played it with her i always make clear that
the guys were only playing it because it was their

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:40.080
sister's game and that was a great experience for
me i just want to thank you that was a surprise

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:46.320
to have this undercoming and not not so much i
mean i kind of expect something from being part

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.680
of infocom um but to have apparently they're
people who really think my game is really good

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:56.000
and that and and it it i wouldn't say it changed
their lives but it made a difference in their

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.800
lives and they remembered it not as oh it's the
failed game of that year which is sort of how

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:06.320
i felt about it at the time of a failed
experiment um so that was kind of a surprise

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.960
i guess if they wanted the success of hitchhiker's
guide they would have as you tried to work

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:15.760
together in a medium that's why the vampire
thing surprised me that they didn't i think

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:22.720
it was um a combination of maybe me not
pushing hard enough she was not as famous

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:28.320
as she is now i mean she'd only written i think
two of the books at that point maybe three um

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:36.400
and that wasn't big enough um i did give pressure
i had worked um on prairie home companion and i as

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:43.440
a an usher for years and new garrison i have had
had potlucks in garrison keeler's kitchen you know

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.440
i won't say we were close personal friends but
you know there was pressure hey see if you can get

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:53.600
garrison keeler and that was surprises me actually
in retrospect because he's much much bigger now

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:59.440
than he was in the 80s but he at least was a name
anne rice was still kind of this kind of culti

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:06.640
vampire person so so i don't know why that idea
didn't take off more now i was assigned to the

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:12.080
long list of people writing um the douglas adams
restaurant at the end of the universe that was

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:18.960
i don't know if that was the fir i think that
came up when i didn't have a good uh game of

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:24.640
my own they said here you will write the next big
hit because it will be the next douglas adams game

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.120
and it wasn't um it was after bureaucracy
and it wasn't um or maybe it was the same

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:36.000
times bureaucracy but anyways a sequel to
hitchhikers and a lot of imps careers died in that

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:45.200
in that game at the time i came on um douglas
was completely unattached to the to the project

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.960
he just didn't want to hammer it through i never
met him personally i stood in the room with him

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:56.560
once when i right after i was hired like the day
after i started he came through and was introduced

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:04.160
to another tester but i wasn't on his game at that
point so i didn't get to meet him but um so he was

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:10.480
not attached to the process the project and then
it was handed off to other people and in the end i

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:16.640
was told seriously that i was going to be writing
the game with a programmer at um i think it was

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:22.240
at magnetic scrolls a competitor's company was
going to tell me how to write the game and then i

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.960
was just going to be the old-fashioned meaning of
the word implementing i was just going to be doing

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:33.200
coding for it and i at that point i said no
this is absurd so i i quit on that project so

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:40.160
you quit the project you put the company on that
project um it was all at the same time you know

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:45.760
it wasn't it wasn't so it was like a standard
breakdown that was a stan yeah that was just

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:51.360
the house isn't clean they didn't take care of the
dogs doing bad at work you know what i'm getting

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:57.360
my back yeah i mean i can't remember the exact
timing actually but but it was it was in the same

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:05.200
period so i do have historical stuff about for
instance bureaucracy um and i mean it's it is

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.400
so that's fine i think it was panic i think
it was panic and i think what made infocom so

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:19.120
great when it was great was exactly what killed
us the um as i understand it what happened was

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:27.680
um they formed the company to be a button-down
three-piece suit with vest and tie business

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.840
company but look we've got these games we'll make
money off the games and then we'll use that for

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:38.240
the real stuff and they ignored the games which
is exactly what you need for creative format for

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.720
for good stuff to happen they ignored the games
they threw a little bit of money at us not near

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:48.080
as much as they should have done if we wanted to
stay alive in the games world because that wasn't

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.880
the point then they funneled off all that money
and put it into the the grown-up stuff and that

00:26:52.880 --> 00:27:00.560
allowed the games people to do what they did best
they they just sort of they were ignored and um

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:06.960
pleasantly neglected which allowed this group of
really brilliant people excluding myself from that

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.800
just come together and create really wonderful
things and a great environment i mean it was

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:18.320
just a really wonderful environment and then when
cornerstone died and the end started happening

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:26.160
suddenly there was this need to make themselves
a totally understandably human nature oh my gosh

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:32.720
we have to now survive on what we were doing
before and make all of our hopes and dreams about

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:40.160
the grown-up business side now we've got to apply
to the game side and applying a micromanagement

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.040
finger to to that side which
is exactly what killed it

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:53.680
so i mean it's kind of through the neglect that
it became was allowed to become great and then

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:59.600
through trying to um capitalize on that greatness
that it killed it i think killed the the call i

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:04.480
don't know that the games are bad i would just
the the late games i would just say that they're

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:10.480
uh they're trying too hard it's it's too much not
let leveling go off and come up with another great

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:16.960
game on his own because he's done it before trust
us you know he'll do this again it's we have to

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:24.080
make sure that it's going to be a win before he
gets out of the gate which you just can't do so um

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:29.040
from the games industry was rather young um yeah
i didn't plan on it it just kind of happened i

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:33.360
could have sort of kept thinking i'll go back
there someday and then i realized it had moved

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:41.760
on without me yeah i didn't i retired in 20 when
i was 26 and i was like why to write yes i keep

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:47.200
doing that i've done that periodically in my life
i'm going to write the great american novel and um

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:55.200
uh actually that was a mistake i was going to
just write a novel and they had this huge party

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.760
for me when i left infocomm and they gave
me a t-shirt which i still have which was

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:08.160
the 1989 winner of the pulitzer prize which
suddenly put these expectations on it that um kind

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:15.200
of killed that in the bud so oh did you actually
take that actually stunt your interest in it or

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:20.560
i'm still interested in it and i'm still kind of
trying to do it but i've never written that novel

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.960
no i keep finding other things to do so i wonder
if i really do want to write the novel if i just

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:31.200
want to keep dreaming about writing the novel well
that's something to be said for that um so let's

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.840
see what i'm going to do yep so because by that
point wheeler's probably already starting to be in

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:43.200
wheeler when i first saw it was already in boxes
yeah it was a dark little place full of boxes so

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:49.920
um i'll start talking about the imp life but
i could also probably talk about the testers

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:54.880
the the building is still around today i think
and i think it's six stories tall and we were on

00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:00.400
the fifth floor and it was um what is now i'm
sure very dated all glass on the outside with

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:07.440
quite beautiful glass atriums from from bottom
to top in the middle and it was all very

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:13.920
buttoned down so you'd arrive i'd arrive whenever
i felt like getting up and i was i was um

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.960
living in oh gosh i lived all over boston at
that time but i was living on the tea so it

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:26.320
was an easy tea trip out and then just a walk of
three blocks over to cambridge park and you go

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:31.840
up the elevator and you're surrounded by you know
button-down places you walk in we've got a formal

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:38.880
reception area and everything's kind of light
and um i should say uh colorless not not light

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:44.880
in a good way it's all colorless and there's gray
carpet and there's white walls and there's no uh

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.440
the thing wheeler had going for it is it even
though when i knew it it was dark in in boxes

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.680
there was a sense of actual artisanship there i
i don't actually know if it was just a rundown

00:30:54.400 --> 00:31:00.080
place but that was the feeling of it there
was no artisan ship at cambridge park and um

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:08.000
it was we were we took up like half the floor
around one atrium and it was all divided up

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.160
with the because when we moved in we were going to
take over the whole floor and i have some memory

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:17.600
that maybe we even did rent the whole floor for a
while and then they in the cutbacks they got rid

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:25.200
of some of the space but it was largely empty so
we had a you'd walk into reception with marketing

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.280
and then beyond that into you you go geez you can
go to the right and go to the imps go to the left

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.280
and you get to the testing area and go further to
the left and around the building you'd be where

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:41.600
the they developed the parser and tim anderson
and the the the guys who i considered the um the

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.320
real programmers work i misspoke not the parser
the interpreters were written over there and then

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:52.880
administration the big guys were down the
hall by themselves in a corner and the the

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:57.840
imps area has probably been described we we had
what we call the bowling alley it was a very

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:03.360
large open room with windows at the end and was
on the corner of the building so all of the imps

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:08.640
on the north side had windows in their offices
with john palace on the corner and then a big

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:15.440
series of windows for the bowling alley and
then a line of offices on the south side with

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:22.640
steve moritzki had the south side windowed office
and then the rest of us had the closed-in offices

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:27.920
on the south side and we did talk about the north
side kids and the southside kids and the north

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:33.200
side were the real programmers and the south side
were the just the dabblers who had the creative

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:37.120
ability and were struggling with the programming
that that was the myth because of course steve

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:42.080
was on the south side but he wasn't considered
one of the real programmers and he didn't have a

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:48.640
computer science degree but um he definitely in
that deserved to be on the north side i think

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:53.760
he kind of enjoyed being on the south side so
the south side was me jeff o'neal and hollywood

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:59.920
who actually was not on the south side it was on
the east side but it was also a windowless office

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:08.880
um i think the intent had been to um when we
got up and running and were famous assuming they

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.040
even were going to have games that there would be
cubicles in the center of that big area and then

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:21.760
we'd have games just routing out our ears from all
the people working all at once so um you'd show up

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:27.520
when you'd ch you'd show up when you'd show up
i don't remember ever being rushed and i'm not a

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:36.160
morning person so i don't think it was an early
time um i would um the doors were always open

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:45.360
except in few cases when people didn't want
to be bothered but it was actually a really

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:50.880
wonderful way to work all of the imps we were
all working on our own projects separately but

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:56.640
in a shared environment and and for me it was a it
was a great it was kind of the perfect environment

00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:01.120
because you have the team the sense of we're all
working together on something but i didn't have

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:06.320
to share my work with anybody else there was no
need to actually work with partners other people

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:13.680
work well with partners i don't but i had the the
team support without the individual butting in

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:24.800
you would say hi you would say hi you'd sit down
i would work on a good day i would forget the time

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:30.080
it passed and i kind of come into myself
six hours later realizing i'd forgotten

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:36.640
to have lunch we worked on old-fashioned
amber monitors plugged into a mainframe it's

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:42.080
kind of hard to even remember how basic
it felt very high tech at the time but

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:50.080
you know it's nothing like you know the cheapest
computer out today um the day would end uh around

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:57.360
separate time the formal day um frequently with
a a boggle party or not party but a boggle game

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.480
which gosh i wish i could get this probably
available now but for many years it was not

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:09.040
possible to have an intranet boggle game so we we
would all be playing it would be whoever signed up

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:15.520
usually imps and testers playing boggle on
the computer for half an hour or so and then

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:20.000
some people would go home if they had families
they would go home to the families others of us

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:28.160
would stay and work later um steve by the way
was by far the best boggle player and i always

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:33.120
thought that i was a poor player because steve
would beat the pants off me and everybody else

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.600
partly just because he's the fastest typist
i've ever known so you could think of the word

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:42.800
it would already be typed out for him i have since
discovered that i have not been beaten by anybody

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:50.480
in boggle ever since i lost or left infocom so i
guess i'm pretty good too but steve was supreme

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.560
every week one day a week
we'd have a an imps lunch

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:05.920
where we would get together and formally
officially share how the game was going bring

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:12.240
up problems ask for help tom snyder productions
would come to those other other outside groups

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:19.280
um above bates when he was sort of working for us
but not yet part of the group would come to those

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:25.680
lunches they were they were semi-formal i think
bruce what's his name the head of activision came

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:33.040
to one of them um and doesn't ring a bell bruce
is what we called him the lawyer the ceo yeah

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:40.560
yeah so who hated infocus yeah he came to one of
those lunches and that was a tense lunch um but

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:46.480
those were and i i i guess you know i was the
girl i was the one who ran out to get the food

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:52.000
john and me john and i would share that and i
still don't think that that was because i was the

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.200
girl i got paid less than anybody else but i don't
think it was because i was the girl it was because

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:02.800
i was the last hired in that group and i was
told before i started you know we're paying the

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:07.280
other guys a lot more than you but we just don't
have the money now now maybe if i had not been a

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:14.880
girl they wouldn't have cut that way i don't i
don't hold it against them whoever they might

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:19.680
be but it was the true fact that i was the one who
would get the lunches and i was the one who would

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:26.560
frequently got the friday party supplies too but i
also kind of like to do that so i would volunteer

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:35.840
um and at the i like to do that so i would
volunteer um and at the ims lunches it was um

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:43.200
you know it was a supportive atmosphere i don't
recall i mean i know there must have been fights

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:47.520
um between imps and i know that there were
fights between imps but i don't recall

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:54.720
anything at these lunches um among us except
sort of supportive geez you know i've got

00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:01.760
a puzzle i can't figure out how to solve it it's
boring how do we solve this puzzle or how do i we

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.400
didn't do coding questions because sitting around
a lunch table is not a good place to do coding

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:13.040
uh problem solving so that wasn't the kind of
thing we discussed that you'd walk over to stu

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:17.680
stu galley is usually the person i'd check
in with depended what what you were looking

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:24.960
for stu was the person i go to for parser
stuff leveling for um really complex stuff

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:31.120
in programming um steve for real questions for
comedy you know how to make something funny

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:39.120
or just how to get out of a pickle in the story
um and then at the imp lunches it was all just a

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:47.440
free-for-all of people talking and suggesting
so that would pretty much be how how it would

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:52.160
work it was everybody working on their own thing
but together and it worked pretty well that way

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:58.960
so um and of course a couple people were
remote but that's the way those things are

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:06.000
um because it's it's the cover it's on the
cover the marketing interviews you the game um

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:11.600
the game packaging when i was it's changed
from all the wonderful unique packaging to the

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:16.800
the look of a matching set of books i mean it fits
in with that that was very very definitely the

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:26.560
perception and the perception um from within that
yeah we really were the best and and it's arrogant

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:32.640
i suppose but maybe it's true i don't know
we certainly have been remembered well um

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:39.200
so we didn't need to we were above all the
we weren't doing just games we were doing

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:46.960
experiences environments and they were more like
books that's how we saw them um you know so yeah

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.720
we would not have any way of knowing but
you know and you want them to know right um

00:39:53.920 --> 00:40:00.240
i'm not sure i can say i think of infocau the
theme song in the back of my head is camelot

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:06.320
camelot which i can't sing right now but um
it was kind of this moment of glory and it's

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:10.960
not to say that it couldn't happen again
i look at the games coming out now which i

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:16.880
don't look at too closely i'm not big into
games um but i don't know i think some of what

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:24.400
made infocom so great was this um individual
vision that they were able to that the the

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:29.200
style of the game and the ability with a text
adventure it's you know it's it is a book

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:34.640
i'll i'll go strongly it is a book just done a
little differently you get an individual vision

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:40.960
in a different way than you do when you're having
to hire voice uh what do they call voice actors

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:46.160
you know mark hamill has to be in this and we've
got to have graphics and we got to have certain

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:52.880
algorithms for the fight scenes and things i i
just it doesn't surprise me that many of the games

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:58.800
the commercial games today are more and more like
sort of um absent hollywood movies it's because

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.600
it's the only way you can make something that
looks like that and um i i do think it's kind

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.760
of amazing the the underground amateur games
that there are maybe they aren't underground

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:12.400
to people who are there but um because
my my response is why would i want to

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.560
it's an unlearned response i want to say this
is not educated it's it's why would i want to

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:23.760
commit to 100 hours of playing some unknowns game
i want i want the stamp of somebody put some money

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:29.600
behind this you know i have to pay for this to
make it worthwhile to prove that it's good but

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:34.560
probably those games are as engaging as
any other book that's written today and

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:40.000
i would think probably for me and the kind
of interests i have more engaging than halo

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.640
so it's not quite fair to compare halo with
flooded hearts but anyway so i don't know

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:54.080
that i have anything to say that hasn't been said
by other people or isn't well known there's a lot

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:59.760
less shooting in blood regards than halo there is
though there are a lot of deaths in blended hearts

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:04.880
and that was there's a lot less shooting in
blended hearts than halo there is though there

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:09.680
are a lot of deaths in blended hearts and that was
strictly because i was trying to keep it easy on

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:15.680
the idea that um it was supposed to be this new
market of people who hadn't played and i didn't

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:20.960
have a good way of making the puzzles easier
more better hints or something so i just have you

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:28.160
die before and it was to make it easy you just
die so that i didn't have to get a puzzle to get

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.640
out of whatever it was and also i didn't have
the space because i was so cramped for space

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:37.360
it was easier to die than to have a landing
room that you know if you step off the cliff or

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:44.560
something apropos very specific uh point about
blended hearts i like the phrase landing room

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.600
see that's a good example of someone who
has an implementation in their background
