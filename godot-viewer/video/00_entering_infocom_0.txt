Oh, yeah. I mean, that's that's easy. That's 
an easy question. I um was in college. I had

0:00:05.760,0:00:11.040
a boyfriend who was ahead of the game and he 
actually sold computers. This in the early 80s,

0:00:11.040,0:00:16.400
so he was ahead ahead. He was a geek 
like most of the people I like. And

0:00:16.400,0:00:21.040
um he introduced me. We would stay up late 
playing text adventure games. So, the first

0:00:21.040,0:00:25.760
one I played actually was a Scott Adams game. I 
think this is the one I played first. Scott Adams

0:00:25.760,0:00:30.960
game about being in the west. I can't remember 
the name of it, but it was a western cowboy

0:00:30.960,0:00:35.840
game. And I graduated from those two Infocom 
games actually before I worked at Infocom.
