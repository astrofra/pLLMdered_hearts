Um, and at the imps lunches it was it was a 
supportive atmosphere. I don't recall I mean

0:00:06.000,0:00:11.600
I know there must have been fights between 
imps and I know that there were fights between

0:00:11.600,0:00:18.320
imps but I don't recall anything at these 
lunches among us except sort of support

0:00:18.320,0:00:23.920
of gez you know I've got a puzzle I can't 
figure out how to solve it. It's boring.

0:00:23.920,0:00:29.920
how do we solve this puzzle or how do I we didn't 
do coding questions because it's sitting around a

0:00:29.920,0:00:35.920
lunch table is not a good place to do coding uh 
problem solving. So that wasn't the kind of

0:00:35.920,0:00:41.280
thing we discussed that you'd walk over to Stu Stu 
Galley is usually the person I'd check in with. I

0:00:41.280,0:00:47.040
mean depended what what you were looking for. Stu 
was the person I go to for parser stuff. Leveling

0:00:47.040,0:00:55.280
for really complex stuff in programming.
Steve for real questions for comedy, you know,

0:00:55.280,0:01:02.720
how to make something funny. Um or just how to 
get out of a pickle in the story. Um and then at

0:01:02.720,0:01:09.600
the in lunches, it was all just a free-for-all 
of people talking and suggesting. Um so that

0:01:09.600,0:01:15.680
would pretty much be how how it would work. It was 
everybody working on their own thing but together.
