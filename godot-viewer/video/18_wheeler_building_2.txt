0:00:00.320,0:00:07.520
So, we had a you'd walk into reception with 
marketing and then beyond that into you you go

0:00:07.520,0:00:11.920
gez you can go to the right and go to the imps 
go to the left and you get to the testing area

0:00:11.920,0:00:16.000
and go further to the left and around the 
building you'd be where they developed

0:00:16.000,0:00:21.120
 the parser and Tim Anderson and the 
the guys who I considered the real

0:00:21.120,0:00:26.160
programmers work. I misspoke. not the parts are 
the interpreters were written over there and then

0:00:26.160,0:00:32.480
administration the big guys were down the hall 
by themselves in a corner. Um, and the imps

0:00:32.480,0:00:38.480
area has probably been described we we had what we 
called a bowling alley. It was a very large open

0:00:38.480,0:00:42.720
room with windows at the end and it was on the 
corner of the building. So, all of the imps on

0:00:42.720,0:00:49.040
the north side had windows in their offices with 
John Palace on the corner and then a big series

0:00:49.040,0:00:55.600
of windows for the bowling alley and then a line 
of offices on the south side with Steve Moritzky

0:00:55.600,0:01:02.960
had the southside windowed office and then the 
rest of us had the closedin offices on the south

0:01:02.960,0:01:07.600
side. And we did talk about the north side kids 
and the southside kids. And the north side were

0:01:07.600,0:01:13.040
the real programmers and the southside were the 
just the dabblers who had the creative ability and

0:01:13.040,0:01:16.880
were struggling with the programming. That that 
was the myth because of course Steve was on the

0:01:16.880,0:01:21.760
south side but he wasn't considered one of the 
real programmers and he didn't have a computer

0:01:21.760,0:01:28.160
science degree. But he definitely in that 
deserved to be on the north side. I think he

0:01:28.160,0:01:32.960
kind of enjoyed being on the south side. So the 
southside was me, Jeff O'Neal, and Hollywood,

0:01:32.960,0:01:38.240
who actually was not on the southside, it was 
on the what would east side, but it was also a

0:01:38.240,0:01:47.440
windowless office. Um I think the intent had been 
to when we got up and running and were famous,

0:01:47.440,0:01:51.680
assuming they even were going to have games, that 
there would be cubicles in the center of that big

0:01:51.680,0:01:57.760
area and then we'd have games just routing out 
our ears from all the people working all at once.

0:01:57.760,0:02:04.640
So, you'd show up when you'd show up. I don't 
remember ever being rushed, and I'm not a morning

0:02:04.640,0:02:13.680
person, so I don't think it was an an early time. 
Um, I would the doors were always open. Um,

0:02:13.680,0:02:22.160
except in few cases when people didn't want to 
be bothered, but it was actually a really

0:02:22.160,0:02:27.680
wonderful way to work. all of the imps, we were 
all working on our own projects separately, but

0:02:27.680,0:02:33.360
in a shared environment and and for me it was a it 
was a great it was kind of the perfect environment

0:02:33.360,0:02:38.080
because you had the team the sense of we're all 
working together on something but I didn't have to

0:02:38.080,0:02:43.360
share my work with anybody else. There was no need 
to actually work with partners. Other people work

0:02:43.360,0:02:51.040
well with partners. I don't but I had the team 
support without the individual butting in
