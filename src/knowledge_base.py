# Wikipedia article about Plundered Hearts
plundered_hearts_wiki = """Plundered Hearts is an interactive fiction video game created by Amy Briggs and published by Infocom in 1987. Infocom's only game in the romance genre, it was released simultaneously for the Apple II, Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit computers, Atari ST, Amiga, Mac, and MS-DOS. It is Infocom's 28th game.
Plundered Hearts casts the player in a well-defined role. The lead character is a young woman in the late 17th century who has received a letter. Jean Lafond, the governor of the small West Indies island of St. Sinistra, says that the player's father has contracted a wasting tropical disease. Lafond suggests that his recovery would be greatly helped by the loving presence of his daughter, and sends his ship (the Lafond Deux) to transport her.
As the game begins, the ship is attacked by pirates and the player's character is kidnapped. Eventually, the player's character finds that two men are striving for her affections: dashing pirate Nicholas Jamison, and the conniving Jean Lafond. As the intrigue plays out, the lady does not sit idly by and watch the men duel over her; she must help Jamison overcome the evil plans of Lafond so that they have a chance to live happily ever after.
As early as 1984, Infocom employees joked about the possibility of a romance text adventure. By 1987, the year of Plundered Hearts's release, Infocom no longer rated its games on difficulty level.
Although this was not the only Infocom game designed in an effort to attract female players (one example being Moonmist), it is the only game where the lead character is always female.
The Plundered Hearts package included an elegant velvet reticule (pouch) containing the following items:
- A 50 guinea banknote from St. Sinistra
- A letter from Jean Lafond reporting the illness of the player character's father
Game reviewers complimented Plundered Hearts for its gripping prose, challenging predicaments, and scenes of derring-do. Other publications said it was a good introduction to interactive fiction, with writing suitable for both men and women. Some noted that the genre might have alienated Infocom's typical audience, but praised its bold direction nonetheless.

Plundered Hearts is a 1987 interactive fiction romance by Amy Briggs, published by Infocom, notable as Infocom's only romance title and the only one with a fixed female protagonist, released across many home computer platforms.
Set in the late 17th century, it follows a young woman kidnapped by pirates who actively drives the plot, navigating intrigue and romance between a heroic pirate and a manipulative governor, a bold genre shift praised for its prose and accessibility despite dividing Infocom's usual audience.

You play Lady Dimsford, a young, aristocratic woman in the 17th century. She receives a letter from Jean Lafond, the governor of an island in the West Indies, informing her that her father is dying of a tropical disease. Lafond sends a ship to bring her to his island. The ship is then intercepted by notorious pirate Captain Jamison. However, it turns out that Lafond has kidnapped Lady Dimsford's father for his own purposes. The Lady and the pirate work together to defeat him.
The game can be played to completion with four potential endings. However, in only one ending do all of the Lady's loved ones survive. If another ending is arrived at, the user is informed that "There are other, perhaps more satisfying, conclusions."
There was a divide within Infocom regarding whether interactive fiction protagonists should be "audience stand-ins", or whether they should have defined characters. For instance, after negative reaction to the anti-hero protagonist of Infidel, implementor Michael Berlyn concluded that "People really don't want to know who they are [in a game]." Plundered Hearts falls on the opposite side of the spectrum. Lady Dimsford's capable and spunky personality subverts the game's "damsel in distress" setup.
